            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Diſcourſe of <hi>Extreme Unction</hi> had gone into the World without any Preface to the Reader, had not your <hi>Vindication</hi> obliged me to direct one to you, who, it may be, will find your ſelf concerned to peruſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papers. I could not by any means ſuffer my ſelf to be diverted from reading your Book that was publiſhed laſt Week, and that not meerly for gratifying a more than uſual Curioſity to ſee what you had to ſay; but rather for the informing of my Judgment; ſince I could not eaſily believe that in ſaying ſo much as you have done, you ſhould yet ſay nothing to the purpoſe. And therefore you may be ſure, I did not fall aſleep, when I came to the Article of <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> but gave you full attention there, becauſe I had ſo lately dwelt upon that Argument, and was juſt then publiſhing my Thoughts about it. Shall I ſpeak my Mind freely? It was to me indifferent
<pb facs="tcp:60864:4"/>whether I ſhould find my ſelf obliged to retract any thing that I had written, or to tell you, as I do, that you have given me no Reaſon at all to do ſo. I am as unwilling to anticipate the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Worthy Perſon againſt whom you are engaged, as to neglect all notice of your <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in a point wherein I am this moment parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned: And therefore I ſhall tell you generally and briefly how the matter ſtands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there ſeems to be a fitneſs in it, but without pretending to deſerve any Thanks from him, or to expect any from you.</p>
            <p>As for what you ſay upon the Text of St. <hi>James,</hi> the main Queſtion is, whether from thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Words, <hi>Is any ſick among you,</hi> taken in Connexion with thoſe that follow, there be more reaſon to believe that it was a ſtanding part of the Presbyters Office to anoint any Chriſtian whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in his Sickneſs, for the Forgiveneſs of his Sins; or from thoſe Words, <hi>The Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up?</hi> To conclude that the Apoſtle having directed all the Sick to ſend for the Elders of the Church, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take notice of a Caſe that happened but ſometimes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of a miraculous Cure upon the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> in which caſe the Sick were to be <hi>anointed with Oil in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60864:4"/>
            <p>Now, Sir, I beg leave to tell you that tho there are many Inducements to the latter Opinion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Firſt part of this Work, which you ſeem not to have been aware of, yet I cannot find any one Exception againſt that, or any Reaſon for the former Opinion in all your performance, which I have not prevented in mine. Which will be ſo evident to thoſe who care to take the pains of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring you and me together: that I need not fear to be ſuſpected of Inſincerity,
<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 190.</note> in deſiring you <hi>whoſe Zeal will not ſuffer you to mitigate the earneſt deſire you have for the Salvation of your Brethren;</hi> in deſiring you, I ſay, to animadvert upon theſe Papers; and that for the Author's ſake, who is, I dare ſay, no leſs concerned to be ſaved, than you are that he ſhould be ſo. You know the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has damn'd us (as far as <hi>Anathematizing</hi> goes) for denying your Sacrament of <hi>Extreme Unction.</hi> If you do in good earneſt believe there was Cauſe for it, let us ſee that you do ſo, by ſparing a little of your Charity to ſave us, if it may be, from this damning Error.</p>
            <p>Certainly I could not deſire to meet with a Man more fit for this Undertaking than you would ſeem to be. For you it ſeems can prove that Extreme Unction is a <hi>Practice that came down from the Apoſtles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71.</note> 
               <hi>and was from Age to Age viſibly continued in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb facs="tcp:60864:5"/>Churches both of the Eaſt and Weſt for</hi> 800 <hi>Years: How,</hi> ſay you, <hi>did the Greek and Latin Churches for the firſt</hi> 800 <hi>Years practiſe this Unction; and do Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who pretend to reform according to the Primitive Purity, reject it?</hi> I perceive you are very ſure of it; pray therefore will you try to make me ſo too, for if you do, I promiſe you to examin all thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the place over again, which led me to an Interpretation of St. <hi>James</hi> different from yours, and that with a double Severity; tho you ſhould not think it needful to paſs the leaſt Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. For I aſſure you it is the practice of the Church for more than 800 Years, and eſpecially the practice of the Firſt ſix Ages, as I underſtand it, that induces me not a little to believe our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of St. <hi>James</hi> to be the true one; which you muſt not blame me for,
<note place="margin">Reply <hi>p.</hi> 65.</note> who ſay, that <hi>the beſt way of proving things from Scripture is to ſhew Antiquity underſtood it ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you thought that your Word ought to be taken in ſo great a Point, you ſhould by no means have leſſened the Authority of it, by telling two (excuſe me Reverend Father! for ſo it is) I ſay, two Tales, in the very ſame Breath wherein you delivered your Oracle about the Antiquity and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality of <hi>Extreme Unction.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60864:5"/>
            <p>One Tale is, and 'tis a notable one, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender himſelf confeſſed <hi>this Extreme Unction</hi> to be ſo Ancient and Univerſal a Practice as you would have it thought to be. Surely if you do not make better Proof out of the Fathers than you have done by the Confeſſion of the Defender, we muſt look out for a new Man to <hi>prove</hi> to us Extreme Unction <hi>by the Univerſal Practice and Tradition of the Church,</hi> as you ſpeak.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> p. 42, 45.</note> I find indeed the Defender confeſſing that that <hi>Interpretation of the Words of St.</hi> James <hi>which he followed, was for</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 <hi>Years eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the undoubted meaning of them,</hi> and that <hi>the ancient Liturgies of the Church, and the publick practice of it, do for above</hi> 800 <hi>Years ſhew that they eſteemed this Unction,</hi> i. e. <hi>St.</hi> James<hi>'s</hi> Unction, <hi>to belong primarily to bodily Cures, and but ſecondarily only to the Sickneſs of the Soul.</hi> Now that he ſhould therefore confeſs Extreme Unction to have been of ſo ancient ſtanding, is to make him ſay the quite contrary to what he does ſay. For the Unction of which he ſpake, was not <hi>Extreme,</hi> but brought to ſhew that <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction</hi> did not in all that time obtain in the Church. I paſs by your Inſinuation that he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Unction mentioned by St. <hi>James</hi> was practiſed by the Primitive Church for the firſt 800 Years. He ſaid no ſuch thing, nor ſuppoſed any ſuch thing, but only that for 800 Years they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
<pb facs="tcp:60864:6"/>St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction to belong primarily to Bodily Cures; which they might do, and yet in leſs time than 800 Years they might bring in an Unction different from that of St. <hi>James,</hi> though both of them were primarily deſigned for Bodily Cures. In the following Diſcourſe I have ſhewn that they not only might do ſo, but that they did do ſo. But I paſs by this, till you give further occaſion to diſplay the Artifice of theſe Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which for the preſent I ſhall leave to your Reader's Diligence to gather, if he will take the pains to compare you with the Defender in this Article.</p>
            <p>The other Tale is, and 'tis Brother to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, That <hi>Cardinal</hi> Cajetan <hi>did not poſitively ſay, as the</hi> Defender <hi>affirmed he did;</hi> who affirmed that Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> freely confeſſed the Words of St. <hi>James</hi> could belong to no other than Bodily Cures. This, Sir, quite diſheartned me, for I took the Cardinal's Confeſſion to be ſo poſitive, that I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it out of the Cardinal himſelf, and inſerted it into a convenient Place of the following Book
<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Diſc.</hi> p. 13.</note>, where any one may find it, and ſo may judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and us in this Matter. For I intend not to produce the Place here too, and to argue the Point preciſely, becauſe 'tis ſo clear that there is no need of words to make an honeſt Man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:60864:6"/>it; and all the Words in the World will ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify nothing if a Man be not ſo honeſt as he ſhould be. The only Pretence you have that the Cardinal did not poſitively ſay, what the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affirmed him to have ſaid, is, that the Defender did not give the Cardinal's own Words, but what he conceived to be his Sence. For he did not tranſlate him as I have done. But, Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it muſt be ſuch another Man as you ſeem to be, who reads the Cardinal's Words, and will not allow him to be as <hi>poſitive</hi> for us, as the Defender ſaid he was. But the worſt of all is this, that you do upon this very occaſion accuſe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Falſification,</hi> that is, of Falſifying <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as you tell us in the Margin. <hi>I told him,</hi> ſaid you, <hi>Firſt, that Cardinal</hi> Cajetan <hi>did not poſitively ſay as he affirmed he did.</hi> So that by your own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you told him ſo in your former Book, and therefore this ſeems to be a very deliberate Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and you ſtand in it ſtill. <hi>But,</hi> then you ſay, <hi>what if he had?</hi> Why truly then the Defender did not falſify <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as you it ſeems are reſolved to ſay that he does. And thus, where you accuſe the Defender of one Falſification, you are your ſelf guilty of two Falſifications in the compaſs of five Lines; one of which is ſo much the more inexcuſable, becauſe it conſiſts in accuſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:60864:7"/>falſly of the ſame Crime. For theſe Reaſons, Sir, we deſire to be excuſed, as to believing that all Antiquity goes this way and that way, becauſe you ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I would not be thought unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhall be content if inſtead of proving Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be for ye, you will anſwer the Arguments of the Second Part to the contrary. Only I deſire you not to repeat any thing you have ſaid here, which you will find ſatisfied there. For inſtance, that the ancient Prayers made mention of Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins, as well as of Bodily Cures; for you will find that

                  <p>HOW well ſoever they may agree in the practice of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; yet as to the Doctrine of it, their moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Writers have
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum de Extr. Unct. c. 2.</note> fall'n ſo foully one againſt another, that to know what it is from them, would coſt more pains than the Thing is worth. And therefore we will be content, and ſurely our Adverſaries will be ſo too, to take it as it is laid down by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Which Council has given too much advantage, for us to deſire any more from the Sentiments of private Authors, which, as they without cauſe complain, we ſo often combat, while we pretend all along to attaque the Eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Church. But if the Reaſons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60864:10"/>upon which the Council proceeded in its Decrees, were not ſo convincing, as to ſatisfy all of that Communion, but very great Men amongſt themſelves have been of contrary Opinions concerning them; this we have no Obligation upon us to diſſemble, how unwilling ſoever they may be to hear of it. I know well enough that an undue Advantage may be made of the Teſtimonies of Authors, and of the Conceſſions of Adverſaries, which are ſometimes uſed to underprop a Cauſe, that wants Truth at the bottom, and has therefore no Foundation of its own; But ſo long as the Arguments and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers which we produce in this Cauſe are good ones, I hope they will not be thought worſe of, if ſome of them ſeemed good alſo to ſome Men of no mean Figure in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now let us ſee in the Firſt place what the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is concerning this pretended <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> The Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Seſſ. 14.</note> has delivered it in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt of all concerning the Inſtitution of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Holy Synod declares and teaches, that our moſt gracious Redeemer who would have his Servants at all times provided with Saving Remedies and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt all the Weapons of all their Enemies, as he has by other Sacraments ſupplied <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with thoſe mighty Aids, by which they may in the Courſe of their Life keep themſelves unhurt by all the greater Miſchiefs that can happen to their Souls; ſo by the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> he has ſet a moſt ſure Guard about them, to make good the end of their Life. For tho our Adverſary does all our Life long ſeek and catch at every occaſion, by any means to devour our Souls; yet there is no time when he ſtrains more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently to exert the utmoſt of his Craft to ruine us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60864:10"/>utterly, and if he can poſſibly, to bereave us of all Truſt in the Mercy of God, then when he perceives the end of our Life to be at hand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But this Holy <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the Sick was <hi>Inſtituted</hi> by our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a Sacrament of the New Teſtament truly and properly ſo called; <hi>Inſinuated</hi> indeed by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> but <hi>recommended</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> to the Faithful by St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, and Brother of our Lord. Says he, <hi>Is any one Sick, &amp;c.</hi> In which Words, as the Church has learned by Apoſtolical Tradition delivered from hand to hand, he teaches the <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Form,</hi> the proper <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of this Saving Sacrament. For the Church has underſtood the <hi>Matter</hi> thereof to be Oil Bleſſed by a Biſhop. For this <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> does moſt fitly repreſent the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, by which the Soul of the ſick Perſon is inviſibly annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And that the <hi>Form</hi> thereof is this;</q> 
                     <hi>By this Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction and by his moſt Holy Mercy, God forgive thee what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Sin thou haſt committed by ſeeing, by hearing, by taſting, by ſmelling, and by touching. Amen.</hi> Which Form is repeated ſeverally in anointing the ſeat of each Senſe; and according to the
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Decret. Eugenii IV. in Conc. Florent. Catech. ad Paroc. de Extr. U. §. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Florentine</hi> Fathers in anointing the <hi>Feet</hi> alſo for the Sins of walking, and the <hi>Reins</hi> for the Senſuality that reigned there.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Moreover the thing ſignified, and the effect of this Sacrament is explained in theſe Words, <hi>And the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed Sins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> For the thing here ſignified, is the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe anointing cleanſeth from Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, (if any yet remain to be expiated) and from the Reliques of Sin; and eaſeth and ſtrengthneth the Soul of the ſick Perſon, by exciting in him a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Divine Mercy; whereby he is in that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60864:11"/>manner ſupported, that the Trouble and Pain which he ſuſtains by his Sickneſs becomes more tolerable, and he reſiſts more eaſily the Temptations of the Devil now cloſely lying in wait for him, and ſometimes, when it is expedient for the Welfare of the Soul, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the recovery of his Bodily Health.</p>
                     <p>But then as to the Perſons who are deſigned, whether to receive or to adminiſter this Sacrament, this alſo is delivered, and that not obſcurely in the foregoing Words. For it is there ſhewn, that the proper Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of this Sacrament, are the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church, by which Word here we are not to underſtand the more Aged, or Honourable amongſt the People, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops or Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is declared alſo that this Unction is to be miniſtred to the Sick, but to thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, who are ſo dangerouſly ill, that they ſeem to be paſt Recovery; whence it is alſo called the
<note n="†" place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum excunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> 
                        <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Dying.</hi> If the ſick Perſons recover after having received this Unction, they may again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by it, when the like danger of Death happens. Wherefore they are by no means to be hearkened to, who againſt the manifeſt and clear Senſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James,</hi> teach either that this Unction is a device of Men, or a Rite received from the Fathers that has neither a Divine Command, nor a Promiſe of Grace; and who aſſert that it is of no longer uſe, as having been applied in the Primitive Church to the Gift of Healing only; or who ſay that the Rite and Uſage of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament, is repugnant to the Senſe of St. <hi>James,</hi> and therefore to be altered; Laſtly, who affirm that this Extreme Unction may without Sin be contemn'd by the Faithful. For all theſe things are moſt evidently contrary to the perſpicuous Words of ſo great an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60864:11"/>
                  <p>So that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Extreme Unction is a Sacrament adminiſtred to dying Perſons, the proper Effect whereof is the cleanſing of them from the Remains of Sin, by the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt; and as appears by the Form of Words uſed in the Adminiſtration, it is applied in order to the forgiveneſs of all Sins that have been committed by means of any of the Senſes. That Authority which they pretend for this Sacrament is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the higheſt, for they ſay it was <hi>inſtituted</hi> by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The proof which they produce for this Inſtitution, is that it was <hi>inſinuated</hi> by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>publiſh'd</hi> by St. <hi>James.</hi> That the Evangeliſt did inſinuate it, and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle publiſh it, we have the Word and Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But I will be bold to ſay, that if Men are not content to rely upon the Authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but will examine its proofs, they may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that neither did St. <hi>James</hi> publiſh, nor St. <hi>Mark</hi> inſinuate any ſuch Doctrine, or Practice as it has eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And therefore the wiſeſt Paſſage in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Council concerning this matter, is, that <hi>they are by no means to be hearkened unto who teach other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than it teaches.</hi> For if we can but perſuade Men to give us the hearing or the reading, we are very confident to make it plain, that not our Objections againſt this pretended Sacrament, but their Pleas for it, <hi>are moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrary to the perſpicuous Words</hi> both of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> who is ſaid to <hi>inſinuate</hi> it, and of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> who is ſaid to <hi>publiſh</hi> it.</p>

                  <head>§. 2. <hi>That</hi> Extreme Unction <hi>can by no means be proved from St.</hi> James chap. v. 14, 15.</head>
                  <p>THE cleareſt proof they have for this pretended Sacrament are doubtleſs thoſe Words of St. <hi>James,</hi> ch. v. 14, 15. <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oil in the Name of the Lord: And the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed Sins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſing that the Inſtitution of a Sacrament were implied in theſe Words, and that the outward Sign thereof were anointing with Oil, yet this could not by any means be the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For according to St. <hi>James</hi> the Sick Perſon was to be anointed in order to the <hi>raiſing of him up,</hi> or his Recovery from Sickneſs. But the Sick are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that Church for <hi>purging away the remains of their Sins,</hi> when they ſeem to be paſt hopes of Recovery. And tho perhaps one or other may recover afterward, yet this is meerly accidental, and beſides the intention of adminiſtring their Sacrament; which they therefore call the <hi>Sacrament of the Dying.</hi> Nay the Sick Perſon in St. <hi>James</hi> was not to be anointed, only <hi>in order</hi> to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but his Recovery was <hi>certainly</hi> to follow, for 'tis ſaid the <hi>Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> Which one Obſervation is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the hope they have in this Text. For St. <hi>James</hi> does indeed adviſe anointing with Oil, but 'tis in ſuch a Caſe when moſt aſſuredly the ſick Perſon ſhould not die:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60864:12"/>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo does require the ſame, but 'tis when nothing can be well expected but the Death of the Patient. Now which way they can gather a Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> from an Authority that requires an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> which is not <hi>Extreme,</hi> how they can prove a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which they pretend to be proper for <hi>dying</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from thoſe Words of Scripture that mention a <hi>Rite never uſed</hi> upon <hi>dying</hi> Perſons; a Man muſt have a great deal of Wit, or rather a good ſhare of the contrary to be able to imagine.</p>
                  <p>Which one thing ſeems to have been ſo well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
<note n="†" place="margin">Bellar. de Extr. Unct. c. 3. <hi>Dico ſecundo, illa verba duo,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and others after him, that they found it neceſſary to interpret theſe Words: <hi>The Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up,</hi> not ſo much of reſtoring Health to the Body, as of cleanſing, forgiving, and quieting the Soul. And ſo they have made St. <hi>James</hi> to uſe Expreſſions in ſuch a Senſe, as never Man of Underſtanding did either before or after him, till the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made it neceſſary for theſe Men to interpret Words againſt all Rules of Speaking. For according to the perpetual uſe of Words, what is it to <hi>ſave the Sick,</hi> but to ſave him from his Sickneſs? What is it to <hi>raiſe up a ſick Man,</hi> but to reſtore him to Health? And who would interpret theſe Expreſſions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but they whoſe Cauſe is deſperate if they be not otherwiſe interpreted? But if it be asked what Grounds they pretend for this Liberty of Interpretation; you muſt know that the Word, <hi>ſaving,</hi> indifferently refers to the healing of the Body, or to the reſtoring of the Soul; and the Word, <hi>raiſing,</hi> tho properly uſed of ſomething that <hi>belongs to the Body,</hi> yet by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> frequently uſed in Scripture, ſignifies alſo to <hi>drive away ſadneſs and dulneſs from the Mind.</hi> Which is true indeed, but nothing to the purpoſe.

For inſtance, to <hi>raiſe</hi> is a Word that may be uſed to expreſs either <hi>awakening</hi> one that <hi>ſleeps;</hi> or <hi>bringing</hi> one that is <hi>careleſs</hi> to <hi>attention;</hi> or <hi>comforting</hi> the <hi>ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> or <hi>recovering</hi> a <hi>Sick Man;</hi> or <hi>giving Life</hi> to one that is <hi>Dead.</hi> But will any Man in his Wits, unleſs he be carried away by the Service of a Cauſe, affirm that <hi>to raiſe him that ſleeps,</hi> does indifferently ſignify all the other things, and not only awakening him out of his Sleep? By the ſame Reaſon <hi>to raiſe the Sick,</hi> can ſignify nothing but to raiſe him from his Sickneſs, and to reſtore him to Health. And tho <hi>Bellarmin</hi> who was reſolved to ſay ſomething for every thing, was not aſhamed to lay down ſo abſurd an Expoſition as the other is, upon Grounds ſo frivolous; yet 'tis a wonderful thing that

                     <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſhould come after him and trifle as the other does, and almoſt in his very Words. Which in ſuch a Man as he was, who ſometimes freely uſed the good Judgment which he had, is one of the greateſt Inſtances that I ever met with of the Power of Prejudice, and the neceſſity they are under of going beneath themſelves, that are forced to ſerve a Party.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon this place had but a little before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the health of the Body is ſignified by this Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſhall ſave,</hi> according to the <hi>Expoſition of almoſt all Interpreters.</hi> And then he adds very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that <hi>ſince the Apoſtle ſpake of Bodily Sickneſs,</hi> it is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Rules of ſpeaking, to underſtand the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> which follows, of <hi>Health of the ſame kind,</hi> that is of Bodily Health. But then by what Authority muſt we underſtand theſe Words <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>raiſing,</hi> of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and reſtoring the Soul too? Why, ſays he, we <hi>are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60864:13"/>not however to exclude the underſtanding of the Welfare and Health of the Soul under theſe Words.</hi> Would one believe that a Man of Judgment ſhould talk ſo pitifully? For if the Health of the Body only, be expreſſed by the Words in Queſtion, which is as plain as any thing needs to be made by Words, then altho the <hi>Health of the Soul</hi> is not excluded thereby, yet the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the Souls Health by theſe Words, is to be excluded; or we muſt for ever deſpair of knowing how much and no more is ſignified by plain Words. If I promiſe a Man Food, my Words indeed do not exclude giving of him Raiment too, but they exclude any other meaning but what the Words ſignify, which is that I will give him Food. As for the reaſon added by <hi>Eſtius,</hi> why the Health of the Soul is not to be <hi>excluded,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe bodily Health is referr'd here to the Safety of the Soul;</hi> 'tis a moſt lamentable reaſon for underſtanding this by that; ſince it will hold as well for underſtanding the Health of the Soul by the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> of the Body, which is every whit as much referred to the Health of the Soul, as the Health of the Body is.</p>
                  <p>The plain truth of the Caſe is this; it is ſo evident that St. <hi>James</hi> by theſe Words means nothing elſe but the Recovery of Bodily Health, that theſe Men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Shifts that were never heard of before, to make ſomething elſe to be underſtood by them, becauſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Sacrament is loſt.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is called <hi>Extreme,</hi> as neither ſtands with their practice in anointing, nor with the uſe of the Word <hi>Extreme,</hi> nor with the

But when a Man is not able to ſtand before an Objection that is againſt him, he muſt ſeem to ſay the ſame thing that the Objection ſays, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> here does, who one would think by theſe Words, makes the Recovery of the Patient the immediate end of their Unction, and will not allow the Unction to be called <hi>Extreme,</hi> as if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated the ſick Man's haſtning to the period of his Life.</p>

I anſwer, becauſe they are driven to it by an extreme neceſſity of feigning ſome reſemblance between the uſe of their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and of that in St. <hi>James.</hi> For 'tis ſo plain that St. <hi>James</hi> promiſes bodily Health upon what he preſcribes to be done, that the Wit of Man is not able to diſguiſe it.

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60864:15"/>
                  <p>Which theſe Men are ſo ſenſible of, that they dare not venture their Cauſe upon this weak Attempt of bending their Sacrament to the Text, by pretending ſome regard in their Unction to the Recovery of Bodily Health; but find themſelves obliged alſo to bend the Text as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to their Sacrament, by pretending that St. <hi>James</hi> does not ſpeak of reſtoring Health only, in thoſe Words of <hi>ſaving the Sick,</hi> and <hi>raiſing him up,</hi> but of cleanſing and ſtrengthning the Soul too, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Eſtius</hi> would make us believe. By which Artifice they have not done their Cauſe ſo much Service, as they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered good will to it, ſince we cannot but obſerve that themſelves were conſcious how impoſſible it is to make the Text and their Sacrament meet, without forcing both the one and the other by an unnatural Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet even thus much violence will never bring them together, ſo long as 'tis manifeſt that to the uſe of this Rite of Anointing in St. <hi>James</hi> as it is by him requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Recovery of Bodily Health is abſolutely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which they can with no Face pretend to be the conſtant or even frequent effect of their Extreme Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince their Doctrine and Practice proclaim it to be the Sacrament of the <hi>Dying.</hi>

                  <p>As for the forgiveneſs of Sins mentioned in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words of St. <hi>James,</hi> it was promiſed upon a ſuppoſition that the ſick Perſon had committed Sins: <hi>And if he had committed Sins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Which plainly ſeems to be the ſuppoſition of a Caſe, that was not common to all that were healed upon receiving the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle. And that even this Promiſe does not afford the leaſt ground for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, will appear when I come to explain the ſeveral Expreſſions in the Text.</p>

                  <p>In the mean time to ſhew that the Power of Truth does ſometimes prevail upon Men of the beſt note in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall cloſe this Point with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of no meaner a Man than Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who determines thus upon this place of St. <hi>James.</hi> 
                     <q>It nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears by the Words, nor by the Effect, that he ſpeaks of the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> which our Lord appointed in the Goſpel, to be uſed upon ſick Perſons by his Diſciples. For the Text does not ſay, <hi>Is any Man ſick unto Death?</hi> but abſolutely, <hi>Is any Man ſick?</hi> And it makes the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be the recovery of the Sick, and ſpeaks but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally of the forgiveneſs of Sins: Whereas <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is not given but when a Man is almoſt at the point of Death, and as the Form of Words then uſed ſufficiently ſhews, it tends directly to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins.</q>

                  <p>THO what hath been ſaid is enough to deprive the <hi>Roman <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of all relief and ſupport from this place of Scripture; yet for the benefit of thoſe, who poſſibly have not well conſidered the Text of which we have been ſpeaking, I ſhall firſt offter the plain meaning of it, and ſhew for what end and purpoſe anointing with Oil was preſcribed by St. <hi>James;</hi> and then confirm the Interpretation by thoſe Arguments that led me to it, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60864:16"/>by ſuch Anſwers as may be ſufficient to remove our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Objections againſt it.</p>
                  <p>We ſay then, that ſeveral extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> were by the Spirit diſperſed amongſt the firſt Believers, for the eſtabliſhing of Chriſtianity in the World; and that one kind of theſe were the
<note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 9, 28, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Gifts of Healing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they who had this Power, were directed by the Impulſe of the Spirit, when or upon what Perſons to exert it. That being thus directed, they called upon the Name of the Lord with aſſurance of the Event, and the Sick were accordingly reſtored to their Health.</p>
                  <p>That ſometimes they did in this manner heal the Sick, upon whom Diſeaſes had been inflicted, as a Puniſhment for ſome Sins they had been guilty of.</p>
                  <p>That in this Direction of St. <hi>James, Is any Man ſick, &amp;c.</hi> he refers to theſe extraordinary <hi>Gifts of Healing;</hi> and that he preſcribes <hi>Anointing</hi> the ſick Perſon <hi>with Oil,</hi> in that caſe only, when the Elders knew by the Spirit, that the Gift of Healing was to be ſhewn, and that <hi>the Lord</hi> would <hi>raiſe him up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in caſe of Sickneſs St. <hi>James</hi> directs the ſick Perſon to ſend for the Elders of the Church, and adds a particular motive ſo to do from the <hi>Gift of Healing,</hi> which then flouriſhed in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that if it ſeemed good to God, which the Elders would aſſuredly know by the Inſtruction of the Spirit, he ſhould by their praying over him be reſtored to his Health. In which caſe to ſignify the Supernatural Gift of God in raiſing him up, they were accordſng to Cuſtom to anoint him with Oil. Whereupon the Event would ſhew that their Prayer was not the Prayer of vain Confidence, but <hi>of Faith,</hi> and that they had not in vain <hi>anointed the Sick with Oil</hi> in teſtimony of their aſſurance of his Recovery; for as he ſays <hi>the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60864:16"/>Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> And to adviſe the ſick Man more effectually to take this Religious Courſe, he adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive, that if that Sickneſs were ſent to puniſh him for ſome Sins that he had committed, even that ſhould not hinder his Recovery, any more than if it had been inflicted only for the trial of his Faith and Patience; for <hi>his Sins ſhould be forgiven him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which Interpretation the main point of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy that remains between us and our Adverſaries, is that, as weſay, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>James,</hi> was a Rite or Ceremony of miraculous Healing. For if this proves true, all their pretence from this place to eſtabliſh a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>Extrema <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> for the Sanctifying of the Soul, and the forgivenefs of their Sins who are ready to depart out of this Life, it is all I ſay irrecoverably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. And therefore let us now enquire into the meaning of St. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and ſee whether there be not ſufficient Reaſon to conclude of it as we do, and no appearance of Reaſon for what they conclude from it.</p>
                  <p>There are but three ways that I know of which the New Teſtament affords to find out the uſe and meaning of this Ceremony at the beginning of the Goſpel. One is to compare this place with <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 13. Another to conſider the Words of the place it ſelf. And a third to ſee what light is given to it, by the following Paſſages in St. <hi>James</hi> that have a manifeſt Connexion with the Text that is under Debate.</p>
                  <p>If our Interpretation will bear the trial of all theſe ways of Examination, and theirs will bear none of them; if according to ours, all things are plain, natural and conſiſtent, and if theirs diſturb every thing, and will not ſuffer thoſe things to hang together which ought to do ſo: Then I ſhould think the Authority of Scripture will plainly enough appear to be on our ſide.</p>

                  <head>§. 4. <hi>What was ſignified by anointing with Oil in St.</hi> Mark.</head>
                  <p>I Begin with the forementioned place of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> which is the only Text in all the New Teſtament, beſides that of St. <hi>James,</hi> where <hi>anointing with Oil</hi> is mentioned. There it is ſaid of the Twelve who were ſent forth by our Saviour to preach, and to confirm their Doctrine by Signs and Wonders; that <hi>they went out and preached that Men ſhould repent; and they caſt out many Devils; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Oil many that were ſick, and healed them.</hi> In which Words it is evident that the anointing with Oil, which the Apoſtles uſed, was the Ceremony of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cure of the Sick: For they give an account of what the Apoſtles did in the purſuance of that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the uſe of that Power which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But that they received Power from him to cure Diſeaſes, is expreſly affirmed by St. <hi>Luke</hi>
                     <note n="(h)" place="margin">Luke ix. 1, 2.</note>, <hi>Then he called his twelve Diſciples together, and gave them Power and Authority over all Devils, and to cure Diſeaſes; And he ſent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the Sick.</hi> And therefore what can be more plain than that <hi>the healing</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> was by the uſe of that <hi>Power</hi> which they had received from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it was miraculous? And conſequently that the <hi>anointing with Oil,</hi> which is joined with it, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Symbol or Sign of the <hi>miraculous Cure.</hi> Now that it was very frequent to uſe certain outward Actions in the performance of a Miracle, is evident alſo from the Scriptures, ſuch Actions namely as could by no means be thought to have any natural force in procuring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60864:17"/>the Effect, but rather to raiſe the expectation of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and to ſignify that what would follow was to be done by a Supernatural Power. Thus before the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Red Sea
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Exod. xiv. 16, 21.</note>, <hi>Moſes lift up his Rod, and ſtretched out his Hand over the Sea, to divide it.</hi> Thus alſo with his Rod
<note n="(k)" place="margin">xvii. 8.</note> he ſmote the Rock in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and Water came out of it. Thus our Saviour to cure the deaf Man that had an Impediment in his Speech,

                     <hi>put his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into his Ears, and touched his Tongue.</hi> And before he raiſed the young Man that was dead
<note n="(m)" place="margin">Luke vii. 14.</note>, he <hi>touched the Bier.</hi> The Examples of which kind are ſo many in both Teſtaments, that there is no need of mentioning any more. And one of them is this before us, of <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sick with Oil,</hi> and healing them.</p>
                  <p>Which Ceremony had been of antient uſe, and was known to have a ſignification not much unlike that of <hi>Impoſition of Hands.</hi> It was commonly uſed to denote the conferring either of Authority and Office, or Gifts and Graces enabling for the Adminiſtration thereof. Whence it might by an eaſy Turn be applied, (as <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands</hi> undoubtedly was) to ſignify ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a Gift and Favour of God to a ſick Man, as that of raiſing him up by a miraculous Power. Eſpecially, if as <hi>Grotius</hi> has obſerved, it was an ancient Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as to join <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> to thoſe Prayers which were offered in any Man's behalf;
<note place="margin">Grot. in loc.</note> ſo when Prayers were made for the Sick to <hi>anoint them with Oil,</hi> in token of their Hope to obtain from God that eaſe and gladneſs in their behalf, which is ſignified by Oil. So that anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Oil having antiently betokened ſometimes ſome ſingular Gift of God, at other times the hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Recovery of the ſick Man, for whom Prayer was made, it might well be a very apt and ſignificant Emblem of a miraculous cure of the Sick; which being both an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60864:18"/>extraordinary work, and withal the cauſe of Joy and Gladneſs, the uſe of anointing upon this occaſion did in ſome degree join both its ancient ſignifications together.</p>
                  <p>But whatever the reaſon might be of the choice of this Ceremony when the Apoſtles healed many ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: This however is very plain, that they healed them by a miraculous Power which their Maſter had given them. And by comparing what St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſays upon this occaſion, with St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> it ſeems to me that <hi>anointing with Oil</hi> was not only a Rite uſed by them to ſignify the miraculous Cure, but that this meaning of it was generally underſtood. My Reaſon is this, becauſe St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who make no mention of the Ceremony, do expreſly affirm the Power of healing to be a Gift which they had now received from <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And St. <hi>Mark</hi> who mentions not the Gift, does only expreſs the Ceremony which they uſed in healing. Therefore becauſe in ſubſtance they all deliver the ſame thing, it ſhould ſeem that St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſufficiently expreſſed the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gift by which the Apoſtles healed the Sick, by ſaying that they <hi>Anointed many with Oil that were Sick, and healed them;</hi> and by conſequence that the uſe of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony upon ſuch an occaſion was ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be an Indication of a miraculous Cure.</p>
                  <p>What St. <hi>Luke</hi> reports, we have ſeen already; and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is no leſs expreſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<note n="(n)" place="margin">Matth. 10.1, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He gave his twelve Diſciples Power againſt unclean Spirits, to caſt them out; and TO HEAL ALL MANNER OF SICK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS, AND ALL MANNER OF DISEASE,</hi> and that he ſaid to them, <hi>Heal the Sick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the Dead, caſt out Devils: Freely ye have received, freely give; i.e.</hi> The Power by which ye are to do theſe things is Supernatural and coſt you nothing, and you ſhall take nothing for the uſe of it. But now
<note n="(o)" place="margin">Mark vi. 7.</note> St. <hi>Mark</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60864:18"/>no other Power in the Commiſſion which <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave them, but that <hi>over unclean Spirits:</hi> And yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what they did in purſuance of their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſays,
<note n="(p)" place="margin">Mar. vi. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>They caſt out many Devils, and anointed with Oil many that were Sick, and healed them;</hi> which Words being compared with what the other Evangeliſts ſay, are to be interpreted in this manner. <hi>And as for the Sick which they healed, that was done no leſs by a Divine and Supernatural Power, than the caſting out of Devils; for they uſed nothing but the known Ceremony betokening an extraordinary work of God in the Cures they wrought, that is, Anointing with Oil.</hi> And thus thoſe Words of St. <hi>Mark</hi> do plainly enough ſuppoſe that Power of healing the Sick to have been in their Commiſſion, tho he did not at firſt expreſs it as the other two Evangeliſts did.</p>
                  <p>Finally, it doth not appear that our Saviour enjoined the uſe of this Ceremony, but it is rather probable that he did not, ſince the Apoſtles healed many Perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And therefore if one ſhould ſay that poſſibly they took it up of themſelves, as a Rite very pertinent for them to uſe upon this occaſion, and which would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be underſtood by all, I do not ſee how he could be confuted. Perhaps it may not be unreaſonably ſuppoſed that they received ſome general Direction from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that in exerting the Gift which he had beſtowed upon them, they might freely uſe this honourable Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or ſome other of like ſignification, that was fit to raiſe the expectation of a miraculous Healing.</p>
                  <p>Now this being the only place in the New Teſtament, where anointing with Oil is mentioned, beſides that of St. <hi>James,</hi> and it being alſo plain that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in St. <hi>Mark</hi> referred to the Gift of Healing, ſurely the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſpoken of by St. <hi>James</hi> muſt have the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe 'tis a place of ſuch obſcurity, that it will be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60864:19"/>very hard to find a Sacrament in it, or to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion whatſoever from it: For in all appearance the very ſame caſe is ſpoken of in both places. The Action is the ſame, <hi>viz. Anointing with Oil;</hi> the Perſons anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are in the ſame Circumſtances, for in both they are <hi>the Sick:</hi> And the Event the ſame, for in St. <hi>Mark</hi> they were <hi>Healed,</hi> and in St. <hi>James</hi> 'tis expreſly ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> What therefore ſhould hinder, but that if <hi>Anointing</hi> were the Ceremony of miraculous Healing in the one, it ſhould have the ſame ſignification in the other? If there were any Difficulty in the Words of St. <hi>James,</hi> and it were doubtful to what purpoſe the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> by him mentioned was applied, one would think the obſcurity ſhould wholly diſappear before the Light that St. <hi>Mark</hi> offers to clear that Text. But that in all appearance the ſame Caſe ſhould be expreſſed in both, and yet there ſhould be ſo vaſt a difference as the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine ſuppoſes, is for them to believe, who make the Scriptures good for nothing, till the Church comes to find out a meaning for them.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon ſome of our Adverſaries have thought fit to prove their pretended Sacrament out of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> well perceiving that without drawing him in for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Doctrine, as well as they could, they muſt be forced to quit St. <hi>James</hi> too. Thus <hi>Maldonate</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mincing the matter, asks <hi>If the Sacrament of</hi> Extreme Unction <hi>be not here [in St.</hi> Mark] <hi>where is it?</hi> A queſtion put not without Reaſon I confeſs; from whence I infer, that here it is not, and therefore 'tis no where to be found in the Scripture. As for his other Queſtion which he preſently adds, <hi>Why is it not here, if it be any where elſe?</hi> I anſwer, that if he could have made good proof that he had found it any where elſe, he would never have ſtretched his Confidence ſo far as to pretend that he found it here.</p>

                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Maldon. Comm. in Evang. Marc. vi.</note> 
                     <hi>In this place,</hi> ſays the Jeſuit, <hi>we are to deal not only with Hereticks, who obſtinately contend that the Sacrament of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction is not here ſpoken of, but alſo with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Catholicks, who ſeem to ſay almoſt the ſame thing, who are nevertheleſs excuſable in great part, ſince theſe new He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics had not yet ſprung up in their time.</hi> And he was ſo well ſatisfied that their Sacrament was gone, if St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Text could not ſave it, that he plainly ſaid; that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this place to be underſtood of the Sacrament of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, was to <hi>make a step</hi> towards the taking of it away, either <hi>maliciouſly</hi> if he were an <hi>Heretic</hi> that did ſo, or <hi>imprudently</hi> if he were a <hi>Catholic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He well knew that the Divines of his Church had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally denied the Unction which the Apoſtles uſed in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to be their Sacramental Unction, and that they had laid the ſtreſs of their Cauſe upon St. <hi>James;</hi> but he ſaw the Inconvenience of it too, that the ſame Unction being indeed ſpoken of in both places, by giving up one, they in effect yeilded both, and ſo left their Sacrament without any Teſtimony of Scripture at all. Thus far therefore his Judgment is to be commended, that he choſe rather to challenge both places, which might be done with the ſame Confidence and the ſame Pains that would ſerve to challenge one of them, than to be at the Charge of wreſting St. <hi>James,</hi> and afterwards to be at a new expence of pains in making St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> to ſpeak of two different Unctions, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſhew a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence where in Truth there was none to be ſhown.</p>
                  <p>But how does this bold Undertaker bring St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Text to his Purpoſe? Why, he proves that the Apoſtles did not uſe Oil as a Medicine, as if any either Proteſtant or Papiſt was ſo weak as to ſay they did: And then he concludes that they anointed the Sick, not <hi>to cure their Bodies,</hi> ſo much as <hi>their Minds</hi> by a Sacrament; as if
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60864:20"/>that Unction muſt needs be a Sacrament, or a Medicine. He pretends that it could not be uſed as a Sign of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cure, becauſe it would have obſcured the Miracle, and led the Spectators into a belief that the Cure was wrought by the natural force of the Oil. And ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch things he ſays which are ſo intolerably trifling, that I am very well pleaſed to be excuſed from giving them any anſwer, by the Confeſſion of the moſt and beſt Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that the Unction in St. <hi>Mark</hi> was not Sacramental, or for the healing of the Mind, but the Body. For this was not taught by <hi>Cajetan</hi> only, but by

                  <p>We have already obſerved that part of the Doctrine of the Council concerning Extreme Unction, was this, that <hi>it was inſtituted by our Lord</hi> Chriſt <hi>as a Sacrament of the New Teſtament truly and properly ſo called; INSIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATED by St.</hi> Mark, <hi>and publiſhed to the Faithful by St.</hi> James. <q>Now, ſays the Hiſtorian, if any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel why it is ſaid in the firſt Head of the Doctrine that this Sacrament is <hi>inſinuated</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> in St. <hi>James,</hi> tho the Reaſon of what goes before, and of that which follows, does require that it ſhould not be ſaid <hi>INSIN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ATED,</hi> but <hi>INSTIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TED,</hi> he may know that it was firſt written ſo:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hiſtory of the Council of</hi> Trent. p. 351.</note> But a Divine having obſerved that the Apoſtles who anointed the Sick, of whom St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeaketh, were not <hi>Prieſts,</hi> becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth, that Prieſthood was conferred upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60864:20"/>them not till the laſt Supper, it ſeemed a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to affirm, that the Unction which they gave was a Sacrament, and that Prieſts only are Miniſters of it. Whereunto ſome who held it to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at that time inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did anſwer, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanding them to miniſter the Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made them Prieſts concerning that action only —yet it was thought too dangerous to affirm it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely: Therefore inſtead of the Word <hi>Inſtitutum,</hi> they put <hi>Inſinuatum:</hi> Which Word what it may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy in ſuch a matter, every one may judg who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth what <hi>Inſinuare</hi> is, and doth apply it to that which the Apoſtles then did, and to that which was commanded by St. <hi>James,</hi> and to the Determination made by this Council.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am far from thinking that Divine's Reaſon againſt St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s ſpeaking of a Sacramental Unction, to be the very beſt that the Caſe affords. However we ſee that tho the Council had a good mind to build their Doctrine upon St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Text, they yet diſtructed the Foundation, and could not heartily venture upon it, and therefore they durſt not ſay their Sacrament was here <hi>Inſtituted:</hi> But on the other hand they were loth to loſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Text in a Cauſe wherein they needed it ſo very much, and therefore they were content to ſay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly that it was <hi>Inſinuated</hi> there. A hard Caſe indeed! that the Holy Synod ſhould have ſo little Judgment, as to ſay <hi>Inſtituted</hi> at firſt, and ſo little honeſty as to put <hi>Inſinuated</hi> afterward inſtead of <hi>Inſtituted:</hi> For I think no other account can be given of this, but that themſelves would fain inſinuate what they durſt not ſay; that the Words of St. <hi>Mark</hi> did after a ſort contain an Inſtitution of their Sacrament, tho their ſhifting plainly ſhewed that they were convinced of the contrary.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60864:21"/>
                  <p>But that place belonging quite to another matter, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Gift of Healing; and all reaſon requiring that St. <hi>James</hi>'s Words be interpreted to the ſame Sence with St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s; this alone is enough to overthrow their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of proving Extreme Unction from St. <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here it may be obſerved that the Power of Truth has extorted from ſome or other of our Adverſaries, the Confeſſion of both the Premiſes which infer our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction which St.</hi> James <hi>preſcribes is the very ſame with that which is mentioned by St.</hi> Mark. For this we have <hi>Maldonate,</hi> and ſome few others with him. <hi>But St.</hi> Mark <hi>does not ſpeak of Extreme or of Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> For this we have <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and a great many more. The Concluſion is evident, <hi>Therefore neither does St.</hi> James <hi>preſcribe any ſuch thing.</hi> And thus much for the firſt way of finding out the uſe and meaning of this Ceremony whereof St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>viz.</hi> by comparing him with St. <hi>Mark.</hi>

                  <p>THE ſecond way I propounded was to conſider the meaning of that place, where St. <hi>James</hi> mentions <hi>Anointing the Sick with Oil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already ſhewn that thoſe Expreſſions of <hi>ſaving the Sick,</hi> and <hi>the Lord's raiſing him up,</hi> cannot without extravagant Liberty, be underſtood of any thing elſe but the Recovery of Bodily Health; [§. 2.] and I have laid down that Interpretation of the whole Text which this Suppoſition requires [§. 3.] and ſhewn that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60864:21"/>Unction there ſpoken of muſt therefore have been the Ceremony of a miraculous Cure. Now there are but two paſſages there, that ſeem to require any farther Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which I ſhall now conſider more particularly, and then leave the Reader to give his Judgment.</p>
                  <p>The one is <hi>the Prayer of Faith;</hi> the other, <hi>If he has committed Sins, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By the Prayer of Faith,</hi> we muſt neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Prayer accompanied with a perſuaſion wrought by the Impulſe of the Spirit, that God would raiſe up the Sick; not with that Faith only which is a perſuaſion of the general Promiſes of God made to the whole Church; ſince there is no ſuch abſolute Promiſe in the Goſpel, that God will grant Health to the Sick upon our Prayer. But St. <hi>James</hi> affirms, that <hi>the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> Which makes it plain that the Faith here mentioned was the perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elders that it was God's pleaſure that at that time the <hi>Gift of Healing</hi> ſhould take place: For, as I ſaid before, Prayer grounded upon the belief of the Promiſes of the New Covenant, or upon that Faith only which is common to all Chriſtians, cannot warrant the obtaining of Health, or of any other Temporal Bleſſing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this the only place where <hi>Faith</hi> is taken for a perſuaſion that God will do a Miracle. For thus we are to underſtand it in that Saying of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <note n="(s)" place="margin">1 Cor. xiii. 2.</note>, <hi>Though I have all Faith ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</hi> In which he ſeemed to refer to that Saying of our Saviour to his Diſciples
<note n="(t)" place="margin">Mat. xvii. 20.</note>, <hi>If ye have Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay unto this Mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove; and nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto you.</hi> And it is very evident that our Saviour ſpake of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60864:22"/>
                     <hi>Prayer of</hi> ſuch <hi>Faith</hi> as this in that Promiſe to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<note n="(u)" place="margin">Joh. xiv. 13.12.</note>, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it. i. e.</hi> Upon their Prayer God would glorify himſelf, and the Goſpel of his Son by the Teſtimony of Miracles: For theſe Words are a Continuation of the Promiſe made in the foregoing Verſe; <hi>He that believeth on me, the Works that I do ſhall he do alſo, and greater Works than theſe he ſhall do, becauſe I go unto my Father.</hi> But this is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo generally underſtood, that I need not inſiſt upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now if the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> was made for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Sick Man, it ſtands to Reaſon that his being <hi>Anointed with Oil</hi> ſhould refer to the ſame matter. For the Apoſtle lays down this Motive to the uſe of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> that <hi>the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick;</hi> And thus theſe Paſſages go eaſily and conſonantly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Whereas if the <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſuppoſed in this place, the whole muſt run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; <hi>Is any Man ſick, let him ſend for the Elders of the Church; and let them adminiſter to him the Sacrament and Office of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, to prepare his Soul for its departure out of this Life; For if they know by the Spirit that the Gift of Healing is now to be exerciſed, and do thereupon pray for his Recovery, he ſhall not depart out of this Life, but the Lord will raiſe him up.</hi> And who does not ſee that at this rate the Paſſages of the Text are not only incoherent, but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with one another?</p>
                  <p>And now it is eaſy from hence to anſwer one of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s principal Objections againſt our Senſe of this place.
<note n="†" place="margin">Bellar. de Extr. Unct. c. iii. §. <hi>Quarto &amp; Oran,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>This Promiſe,</hi> ſays he, The Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, &amp;c. <hi>is abſolute, and therefore its principal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60864:22"/>cannot be to the Health of the Body. For the Sick who were anointed as St.</hi> James <hi>preſcribes, were either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways healed, or not always: If always, then none had died in the Days of the Apoſtles, but ſome very few who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed St.</hi> James <hi>his Rule: Moreover Bodily Health being not always profitable to the Soul, is not always obtained from God, tho it be prayed for by one that has the Gift of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They therefore that were anointed were not always healed; ſo that either that abſolute Promiſe of St.</hi> James <hi>is falſe, which cannot be, or which is moſt true it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and abſolutely to be referred to the Soul.</hi> We are agreed then that the Promiſe upon <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> and the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> is abſolute; but the Cardinal will not have Bodily Health to be the thing promiſed; for then none had died but thoſe few that neglected to procure Unction. Now one would think that this Objection were every whit as ſtrong againſt making the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed effect of Unction to be the Health of the Soul. For thus it would be impoſſible for any to be Damn'd, but thoſe few that neglected to be Anointed; which is very comfortable Doctrine indeed to ſome People, but ſo falſe withal, that I believe our Adverſaries themſelves would be aſhamed to defend it openly.</p>
                  <p>But there is no ſuch Inconvenience belonging to our Interpretation of this place as the Cardinal pretends. I grant that all they were healed, who were anointed as St. <hi>James</hi> preſcribes; but that very few muſt therefore have dyed in thoſe Days, does by no means follow, unleſs that be ſuppoſed alſo, which can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Presbyters without making any difference were to anoint all the Sick in thoſe Days. But that they did not anoint all, ſeems very evident from this, that the Unction was to go along with <hi>the Prayer of Faith:</hi> But the Prayer of Faith was not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60864:23"/>offered for All, and therefore neither were All anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For I have already ſhewn that by the Prayer of Faith in that place we are to underſtand asking a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the direction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and therefore ſuch Prayer was not offered for All indifferently, but for thoſe only whom it pleaſed God ſo to reſtore to their Health.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal ſays moſt truly, That <hi>Bodily Health being not always profitable to the Soul, was not always obtained from God.</hi> But it was raſhly done to add, <hi>though it was prayed for by one that had the Gift of Healing.</hi> For thoſe that had the Gift of Healing were under the Direction of the Divine Spirit, when to ſhew the miraculous Gift of God, and when to forbear; they knew by that Supernatural Direction when it was for the Glory of God and the Good of the Church, or the Spiritual Advantage of the Sick Perſon, that he ſhould recover; and then followed the Prayer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an aſſurance of the Event, here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> together with Unction, the uſual Rite of miraculous Healing. We have already remembred how our Lord promiſed to his Diſciples, That <hi>whatever they ſhould ask in his Name he would do it;</hi> and yet it is not to be thought that they ſhould be able at their own pleaſure to do Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, either for the gratifying of a wanton Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or when the Glory of God did not require it; but that they would ſtill be under the impulſe and guidance of the Spirit, when to undertake a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Operation in the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Thus before ſome notable Miracles, it is ſaid of them that they were <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt; i. e.</hi> they were raiſed by a ſtrong ſuggeſtion of the Spirit to the aſſured Expectation of thoſe great things that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60864:23"/>were preſently done. There was not only a Divine Power that wrought thoſe Things, but there was alſo a Divine Impulſe upon the Minds of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Servants, warranting them to undertake that they ſhould be done. And therefore ſuch wonderful Things were not done upon every occaſion, when perhaps the Wiſdom of Man would have called for them, but only when it ſeemed good to the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Miracles flouriſhed in the Church in the Apoſtles Days, but yet even then they were under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the Divine Pleaſure. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was once delivered out of Priſon by a Miracle; But St. <hi>Paul</hi> more than once uſed his Prudence to gain his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſave himſelf. In particular the <hi>Gift of Healing</hi> flouriſhed in the Church in thoſe Days, and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed <hi>Timothy</hi> to drink a
<note n="(w)" place="margin">1 Tim. v. 23.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay then that the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; that when the Presbyters anointed the Sick with Oil, and asked his Health in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they were aſſured of the Event; that the ſick Perſon at that time was healed, and that the Lord raiſed him up; but that they asked not this in behalf of the Sick, without the guidance of the Divine Spirit by which they were acted. And therefore <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> might have ſpared that Scruple; that very few Believers muſt have died in the Apoſtles Days, if the Unction and the Prayer of Faith is to be referred to the recovery of Bodily Health.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That other Clauſe, <hi>If he has committed Sins, they ſhall be forgiven him,</hi> is a Promiſe made upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60864:24"/>Suppoſition of a Caſe, which did not always happen in the uſe of Anointing the Sick. Now I am yet to underſtand why the Apoſtle ſhould make a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſuch a ſpecial Caſe as that of the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſon's having <hi>committed Sins,</hi> if Unction was preſcribed as a Sacrament for the Remiſſion of Sins? For the Suppoſition taken with the reſt of the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, plainly enough implies, a Direction to anoint the ſick Perſon for whom the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> was made, whether he had committed Sins or not; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>if he had committed Sins, they ſhould be forgiven him.</hi> Whatever St. <hi>James</hi> means here by <hi>having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Sins,</hi> it is yet evident that this was not the Caſe of all that were anointed; and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meant alſo by the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins</hi> in this place, neither was this promiſed to all that were anointed; which ſeems to be a ſhrewd Argument that he did not preſcribe Unction as a Sacrament for the Remiſſion of Sins: Eſpecially if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the Caſe of all that were anointed was this, that they were Sick, and that the Promiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely made to all that were anointed, was the Recovery of their Health; for this ſhews as clearly on the other ſide, that St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction was the Ceremony of a miraculous Cure of the Body. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we are to gather the meaning of this Rite from the Words of the Text where it was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, we are rather to refer it to that Effect which the Apoſtle tells us would certainly and always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Recovery of Health;</hi> than to that which would never follow, but in a ſpecial Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> And 'tis certain that St. <hi>James</hi> makes the conſtant Effect of his Unction to be the Recovery of Bodily Health; and he aſſures
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60864:24"/>us that ſometimes the Forgiveneſs of Sins would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. We therefore ſay that his Unction was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Rite of the Gift of Healing, and thus it always ſignified ſomething. But our Adverſaries will needs have it, that his Unction was a Sacrament, and that the proper end of it was Remiſſion of Sins, and that the Recovery of Bodily Health was a Thing by the Bye, which fell out now and then, as it might be expedient: <hi>i. e.</hi> They will have the Apoſtle to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Bodily Health, as a Thing by the Bye, in Words that expreſs an abſolute Promiſe of it; and they will have him promiſe Forgiveneſs of Sins to all upon the due uſe of Unction, in Words that manifeſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he promiſes it but to ſome only; and conſequently that he eſtabliſhed an Unction which would always be a Sacrament, and yet ſometimes would be no Sacrament at all.</p>
                  <p>I think therefore that I may conclude, For any Man to make anointing the Sick to be a conſtant Means and Sign of that Grace which could not take place in many of thoſe who were qualified for Unction, and were duly anointed according to the Direction of the Apoſtle, is to make the Apoſtle talk very vainly, that himſelf might not ſeem to do ſo: And not to make that to be the end and meaning of his Unction which took place in all that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, is to make the Apoſtle mean what we liſt, and not what his Words mean.</p>
                  <p>If indeed St. <hi>James</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Is any ſick among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oil in the Name of the Lord, and his Sins ſhall be forgiven him; and if it be expedient for the good of his Soul, the Prayer of Faith ſhall alſo ſave the Sick, and the Lord
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60864:25"/>ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> Had it been thus, I ſay, I would know if our Adverſaries would not have exclaimed againſt us as the moſt obſtinate Perſons in the World, if we had either denied forgiveneſs of Sins, or affirmed the recovery of Bodily Health, to be the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of that Unction whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaks. But now his Words are quite otherwiſe, for on the other ſide, the promiſe of Bodily Health is abſolute, and belongs to all that are anointed; and that of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins is conditional, and belongs only to thoſe who have committed Sins. Let our Adverſaries therefore judg impartially for once; and if they do, then I am ſure they will reaſon againſt their own Senſe of this place from the Apoſtles Words as they now ſtand; as they would have argued againſt ours, if they had ſtood as fairly for them as they do for us.</p>
                  <p>But to ſee how any thing will ſerve for an Argument in a deſperate Caſe. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would make us believe, that theſe very Words, <hi>And if he have committed Sins they ſhall be forgiven him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bell. de Extr. Unct. c. iii. §. <hi>Quinto: Et ſi in peccatis,</hi> &amp;c.</note> do ſo clearly bring the Text on their ſide, that there is no room for Evaſion. For <hi>theſe Words,</hi> ſays he, <hi>expreſly refer to the Soul, but the Gift of Healing belongs to the Body.</hi> A wonderful Reaſon ſurely! But muſt not the Apoſtle ſpeak of a Spiritual Effect which in one Caſe is conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Unction of the Sick, but it muſt always be the thing ſignified and intended by it, and this tho he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſuppoſes that the Spiritual Effect <hi>is not,</hi> and plainly tells us what <hi>is</hi> the <hi>conſtant</hi> Signification and Effect of it? When Men of parts take invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their own Opinion, and pretend that they are unanſwerable Proofs for it, what ſhall a Man ſay to it, but that they labour under invincible Prejudice, or ſomething that is a great deal worſe?</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60864:25"/>
                  <p>It appears already from that paſſage concerning <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins,</hi> that the Anointing in St. <hi>James</hi> was properly a Rite that referred to the Gift of Healing: And this will farther appear by conſidering what muſt be the ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>And if he have committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that the Apoſtle ſhould make the anointed perſons, having committed ſins, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſuppoſition, as if ſome that were to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had committed no ſins at all. But now, becauſe, without all Queſtion, neither was the Apoſtles ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vain and idle, nor is it true of any mere Man, that he never ſinned; therefore by <hi>committing ſins,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did not mean ſimply and abſolutely <hi>having ſinned;</hi> but with reference to that matter only whereof he was then ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> that bodily ſickneſs which was to be removed by the Gift of Healing. So that the meaning muſt neceſſarily be this, <hi>And if he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch ſins as it pleaſed God to puniſh by viſiting him with ſickneſs, they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Beſides thoſe places where <hi>committing</hi> and <hi>not committing ſin,</hi> are to be underſtood with ſome qualification, ſuch as that,
<note n="y" place="margin">1 Joh. iii. 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil. And whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> There is one ſaying of our Saviour, that requires the ſame Interpretation with this paſſage in St. <hi>James.</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Joh. ix. 2, 3.</note> When <hi>his Diſciples asked him, Maſter, who did ſin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?

It was for no ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him or his Parents, that he was born blind, <hi>but that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> In like manner the ſuppoſition of the ſick Man's having committed ſins, is to be limited by reference
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60864:26"/>to the Caſe now diſcourſed of, that is, of his Sickneſs. For whether it came in the ordinary and natural courſe of things, or whether God ſent it for the trial of his patience and ſubmiſſion, <hi>the Prayer of Faith ſhould ſave the ſick;</hi> or if it were inflicted as a puniſhment, and for his Correction, God would releaſe him of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and <hi>raiſe him up,</hi> and <hi>his ſins ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not perhaps unfit to remember in this place, that in the beginning of the Church, it pleas'd God to inflict bodily Diſeaſes upon many Chriſtians that had grievouſly offended in any kind, and this not only in purſuance of Church Cenſures, but ſometimes without them: which was the Caſe of thoſe in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who for their unworthy behaviour at their Aſſemblies for Celebrating the Holy Communion, were viſited with Gods hand.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.30.</note> For ſaith St. <hi>Paul, For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep. i. e.</hi> Many are dead of thoſe Sickneſſes which God ſent to chaſtiſe you for that great fault that reigned amongſt you, and many of you remain under thoſe Sickneſſes ſtill, being not yet humbled under the mighty hand of God.

                  <p>Now altho it was the congruity of this place to the paſſage in St. <hi>James,</hi> concerning the ſuppoſition of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed ſins,</hi> that led me to interpret the one by the other; yet upon farther inquiry, I found the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60864:26"/>notion not to be altogether deſtitute of Antiquity. For Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> in his Notes upon this Clauſe, applies St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Text to it in this manner.

                     <hi>Many for ſins done by the Soul, are puniſhed with the ſickneſs, or with the death alſo of the Body.

                  <p>So that beſides the reaſon of the thing, we have ſome Authority too, to interpret this place as I have done; <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe words, <hi>And if he has committed ſins,</hi> are to be referred to ſuch Caſes as that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſes of; where the Sickneſs was inflicted for the puniſhment of ſome notable and ſcandalous fault; not excluding thoſe inſtances of ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſins ſecretly committed: But for whatever ſin the ſickneſs was ſent, it ſhould be forgiven, and God would ſhew, that he had received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he ſick perſon into favour again, by taking off his ſickneſs: For <hi>in this caſe alſo,</hi> the Prayer of Faith ſhould ſave the ſick. Thus our Saviour demonſtrated the Truth of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Man ſick of the

In like manner, and with like expreſſion, St. <hi>James</hi> does promiſe, That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> the Gift of Healing ſhould take place, even where the Diſeaſe was inflicted for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſins.

                  <head>SECT. VI. <hi>That our Interpretation of the uſe of Anointing in St.</hi> James, <hi>and not our Adverſaries, is favoured by the following paſſages to the end of his Epiſtle.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE third way of inquiry was, to ſee what light is given to the meaning of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by thoſe following paſſages that are in connexion with the place under debate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The very next words that follow, are theſe, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed.</hi> But whether by praying one for another in this Verſe, be meant <hi>the Prayer of Faith</hi> in the former Verſe, which referred to the Gift of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was accompanied with a perſuaſion, that God would raiſe up the ſick; or only praying, that God would raiſe him up, when they had no abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60864:27"/>that ſo it would be; is what I dare not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſay, having no clear reaſon to determine me one way or other. But in which ſenſe ſoever the words be taken, as they muſt be in one of them, they ſeem to have a very reaſonable connexion with what went before; and either way this Exhortation is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that ſpecial Caſe mentioned juſt before; <hi>And if he has committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> is here meant (as I think it is) then St. <hi>James</hi> exhorts the ſick perſon, whom God had viſited for his ſins, to humble himſelf and give glory to God, by confeſſing to the Elders thoſe ſins which lay upon his Conſcience; and likewiſe intimates, that the <hi>gift of healing</hi> would not otherwiſe take place in his Caſe; and therefore he was firſt to confeſs, and then the Elders to pray over him. As for Anointing with Oil, it was enough that the Apoſtle mentioned that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it being a Ceremony, which (or ſome other of like ſignification) was cuſtomarily uſed in the Church upon Healing by a miraculous Gift. The main matters are thoſe which he urges here, Confeſſion and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on the part of the ſick Man; and then the Prayer of the Elders on his behalf, which would certainly prevail for his recovery no leſs than in any other Caſe, if it was the Prayer of Faith mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>But if the Prayer here ſpoken of were not the Prayer proceeding from a perſuaſion that the ſick would be healed, but the ordinary Prayer of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one for another, imploring the recovery of the ſick perſon, if it ſhould ſeem good to God; then this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may well be conceived to run thus; <q>But whether the Elders be inſtructed by the ſpirit, that the Gift of Healing is, in the Caſe laſt mentioned, to take place, or no; yet let the ſick perſon confeſs his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60864:28"/>faults, and then let the Elders pray for him, that he may be healed, which God may be pleaſed to grant, though not in the way of demonſtrating that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gift of Healing, which is ſo frequently ſeen in the Church.</q> And if this be the meaning, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there is no mention here of Anointing with Oil, which was a Ceremony proper to that Gift.</p>
                  <p>But let the meaning be this or that, we have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the place, that the effect of Confeſſion and Prayer here expreſſed, is no other than that the perſon might be <hi>healed, i. e.</hi> recover his bodily health; which is a farther Confirmation, that St. <hi>James</hi> had not before directed to the uſe of a Sacrament for the Soul; but to the uſe of that Gift then flouriſhing in the Church, which was for the ſaving of the Body; though that alſo was deſigned for the good of Souls, as indeed all other miraculous operations were, and all the gifts of God whatſoever. And this is ſo great an advantage in favour of our Concluſion, concerning the intent of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction in the former Verſe, that here alſo our Adverſaries do find it neceſſary to pervert the meaning of thoſe plain words, <hi>that ye may be healed,</hi> and to interpret them of the delivering of <hi>the Soul</hi> from ſin;
<note place="margin">Eſt. in loc.</note> as <hi>Eſtius</hi> does in particular, and that upon no other ground, but becauſe <hi>Health in the Scriptures is often referred to the Soul.</hi> But concerning the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of this interpretation, I have ſpoken already, §. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It follows. <hi>The effectual fervent Prayer of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man availeth much,</hi> i. e. it availeth ſometimes to the producing of ſtrange and ſudden effects, (as the example of <hi>Elias</hi> ſhews, which is immediately added): which is a good argument to back the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of confeſſing to one another, and praying
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60864:28"/>one for another, ſuppoſing that thoſe Prayers of good Men are to be underſtood, which are grounded upon the general promiſes of God only. But to me it ſeems more probable, that <hi>the Prayer of Faith</hi> is ſtill meant, becauſe of the inſtance of <hi>Elias</hi> his Prayer, by which the Apoſtle does preſently illuſtrate his meaning. And to this notion the Greek word,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> which we tranſlate <hi>Effectual fervent,</hi> is very favourable; becauſe it aptly ſignifies that incitation and impulſe of the Holy Spirit, which operates <hi>the Prayer of Faith.</hi> But altho this ſenſe appears reaſonable, I will not ſtand upon it, if equal reaſon can be given for another. It will be ſufficient to my purpoſe to obſerve, That altho the prevalency of a good mans Prayer is here affirmed in general terms; and tho without all queſtion ſuch a Mans earneſt Prayer is very forcible for the obtaining of ſpiritual benefits, which is the beſt force they have; yet the Caſe of which he ſpake juſt before <hi>[that ye may be healed]</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his meaning of that power of Prayer which he ſpeaks of here, to that of producing temporal effects. Which limitation is required no leſs by that which follows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Elias <hi>was a man ſubject to like paſſions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and three months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</hi> Now that both in the one Caſe and in the other, the Prayer of <hi>Elias</hi> was the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> in the ſenſe ſo often already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, cannot juſtly be queſtioned; for as we know from St. <hi>James,</hi> that he prayed that it might not rain, and again that it might rain; ſo we know by the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, that he expreſly and abſolutely foretold to <hi>Ahab,</hi> both the

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60864:29"/>it is evident, that this is an inſtance of the power of Prayer to produce temporal effects of a ſurpriſing and wonderful nature; which makes the inſtance pertinent to what he had been ſpeaking of before. Nor is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous to obſerve, That as the withholding of rain for ſo long time upon <hi>Elias</hi> his Prayer, does in part anſwer the Caſe of a Sinners being ſmitten with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his tranſgreſſion; ſo the ſending of rain upon the Prayer of <hi>Elias,</hi> does fully anſwer the Caſe of the ſick Mans recovery, by means of the Prayer of Faith.</p>
                  <p>And now I may appeal to the Judicious Reader, whether our Adverſaries making St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction to be a Sacrament for the immediate benefit of the Soul, does not imply it to be brought in without any cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or pertinence to thoſe paſſages which lie about it; and whether there be not a clearly pertinent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion from one end to the other, ſuppoſing it to be mentioned as a Ceremony of the Gift of Healing.</p>
                  <p>As for their referring all to the Soul, that is here ſaid with reference to Anointing, it carries indeed a ſhow of Piety; and but a ſhow, unleſs it were a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to found a Doctrine upon a place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that will not bear it. What they ſay to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is very true, but 'tis not the meaning of the Text. Their fault is, that they introduce it in the wrong place: But if they would be content to bring it in, where St. <hi>James</hi> brings it in, they had both kept to the true interpretation of his words, and withal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the obſervation of that moſt neceſſary Point, That how great temporal bleſſings ſoever we receive from God, they are not yet to be compared with our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſts and our concerns in another Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For St. <hi>James</hi> having finiſhed his Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Healing of the Sick, does immediately cloſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60864:29"/>all with this inſtruction. <hi>Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, Let him know, that he who converteth the Sinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>After all, when any Chriſtian does by wicked practiſe depart from the truth which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, and one of his Brethren, by charitable admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by earneſt Prayers to God for him, brings him into the way of his duty again; let him know, that this is an infinitely better work, than to recover the ſick, tho by the Gift of Healing, which of it ſelf extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no farther than to a temporal benefit. For he that brings a Sinner to repentance, is a means to ſave that Mans Soul, and ſhall himſelf find mercy from God for this Charity to his Brother, more than if he had wrought never ſo many miraculous Cures upon the Bodies of the ſick.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have ſhewn, That the parallel place in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> that the Text it ſelf, and the Context, do all of them lead to one and the ſame interpretation of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a Ceremony of the Gift of Healing; which is ſufficient to overthrow all pretence for eſtabliſhing a Sacrament of Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the Authority of the Scripture.</p>

<note place="margin">1 Cor. xii. 9, 10.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>Gifts of Healing,</hi> and between the <hi>working of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> the latter ſeeming to ſignify the Curing of the <hi>blind</hi> and the <hi>lame,</hi> and the raiſing of the <hi>Dead,</hi> as the former ſignifies recovering the ſick. And what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is there, that St. <hi>James</hi> when he ſpeaks of one Caſe, muſt ſpeak of the other too? Or that he muſt ſpeak of both or neither?

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60864:30"/>the other.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is alſo objected,
<note place="margin">Bellar. c. iii. §. <hi>Secundo: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducat,</hi> &amp;c.</note> that if the miraculous Gift of Healing were here intended, St. <hi>James</hi> had required the ſick to call for <hi>thoſe that were endued with that Gift, rather than for the Elders,</hi> ſince others would ſerve for this purpoſe no leſs than they: To which it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſay, That if this Gift was no leſs amongſt the Elders, than amongſt Lay-Chriſtians, it was reaſonably adviſed to ſend for the Elders, who had the Gift which others had, and that Authority which others had not, and withal ſome degree of knowledge in ſpiritual things, which was not common to all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is again objected, That if the miraculous.
<note place="margin">Ibid. §. <hi>Tertio: Orent,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Gift were here to be underſtood, Oil had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, becauſe the <hi>power of miracles</hi> was exerted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>not tied</hi> to any ſuch condition as that. <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſay alſo, that it was not <hi>tied</hi> to it, it being certain, that the Apoſtles healed ſome without it. But it was a ſufficient ground for St. <hi>James</hi> to direct anointing in this place, that it was the uſual Rite that went along with the Exerciſe of the Gift of Healing, as St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Text ſtrongly intimates [§. 4.] And becauſe the Gift was ſometimes exerted without the Ceremony, we have reaſon to think, that St. <hi>James</hi> does not preſcribe the Ceremony as a thing neceſſary, but rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it as a thing cuſtomary; not as that upon which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60864:31"/>the Healing depended, but with which, when it was convenient, it was wont to be grac'd.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.
<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>Sexto; Omnia alia,</hi> &amp;c.</note> We are told, that ſince all other directions in this Epiſtle belong to us, no leſs than to the faithful in the Apoſtles days, therefore this muſt do ſo too; and therefore it is not to be underſtood of the Gift of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is of long diſcontinuance, but of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is to continue always in the Church. Which is as much as to ſay, That becauſe the main deſign of the Apoſtolical Epiſtles was to inculcate duties to which the Church is equally obliged in all Ages, therefore they never laid down any Rules peculiar to the State of the Church in their own times, when it flouriſhed with ſupernatural Gifts. Which is ſo groſs a falſhood, that becauſe thoſe of our Communion read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, they cannot be impoſed upon by it.</p>
                  <p>I know no other Objections but what have been anſwered in ſome part of the foregoing Diſcourſe: Unleſs this be one, That the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> have thought fit to fix an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all that diſſent from them in this Point.

                  <head>SECT. VIII. <hi>That St.</hi> James<hi>'s Text affords uſeful admonitions, though it is far from eſtabliſhing a Sacrament of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ONE of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Objections was this, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Interpretation of the Text in St. <hi>James, it belongs not to us,</hi> he meant, That it would be impertinent in us to anoint the ſick with Oil, becauſe the Gift of ſupernatural Healing is hardly to be found. But his expreſſion was a little too large in ſaying, That <hi>theſe things</hi> therefore <hi>would not belong to us.</hi> For thoſe things may be ſaid to belong to us from whence we may reap very good Inſtruction, as certainly we may from <hi>theſe.</hi> This paſſage concerning ſo notable a Gift, as that of Healing was, is one of thoſe that make up the Teſtimony which God gave to the Chriſtian Religion in the early days of the Church, and <hi>it belongs to us</hi> to take notice of them all, for the ſtrengthning of our Faith. And there are many good inſtructions beſides which this place affords, that will be uſeful to the Worlds end. And therefore I ſhall cloſe this part with repreſenting what they are.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60864:32"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Is any Man ſick? he ought to take his ſickneſs as coming from the hand of God, though perhaps not ſo immediately as ſickneſs was ſometimes inflicted upon <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the Primitive Church. He ſhould conſider with himſelf, that this is one of the ordinary trials of a Mans Faith and Patience, and that he is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to blame if he does not bear it as a Chriſtian ought to do. Or he is to reflect, whether it be not for ſome ſin yet unrepented of, that God in his goodneſs hath thought fit to give him this warning; that he may make his ſickneſs the beginning of his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a Member of the Church which is <hi>the Body of Chriſt,</hi> he is alſo to ſend for Gods Miniſter in the Church, that he may receive the benefit of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: To which end the beſt courſe he can take is, to confeſs his fault, and to lay open the grief of his mind, ſince the Miniſter will thereby be better enabled to make ſuch applications to his Caſe, as may be effectual to procure his amendment for the future, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at preſent; and the ſick perſon be in leſs danger of letting himſelf looſe to ſelf-flattery and preſumption, or of being over-whelmed with too much Grief. It is not to be thought that the Elders were ſent for in the Primitive Church merely for the Gift of Healing, for that did not always take place, but for the benefit alſo of ſpiritual inſtruction and conſolation which always did.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a means for the recovery of his Health, the ſick perſon is to deſire the Prayers of the Miniſter. For tho we cannot with any modeſty pretend to <hi>the Prayer of Faith</hi> here mentioned, that is, of a certain perſuaſion, that the perſon for whom we pray ſhall be raiſed up; yet we ought to pray in this Faith, that it is pleaſing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60864:32"/>to God when we expreſs our dependence upon him
<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. iv. 6.</note> by asking thoſe things which we need; that every good thing comes from him, and therefore health and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Death; that tho he does not always give that particular thing which we ask, yet 'tis ſometimes denied becauſe we do not ask; and that as he never gives the greateſt bleſſings of all, which are thoſe of a good mind, but in anſwer to Prayers; ſo ſometimes he does not ſend bodily good things, becauſe he is not prayed to for them: Finally, That there is no leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for Prayer when God raiſeth up the ſick, by bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ordinary means, than when it was done by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Gift.</p>
                  <p>The diſcontinuance of the Gift of Healing has not ſo altered the Caſe, but that God as truly forgives the ſins of the penitent ſick Man, in reſtoring him to health now, as he did then when a Miracle was ſeen in the recovery; and the Prayers of the Elders of the Church are now to be deſired for the one, no leſs than they were heretofore for the other; eſpecially ſince even in thoſe times they did not always pray one for another, with aſſurance to obtain the thing they asked, and the event was to declare, whether God ſaw it expedient to grant their requeſts. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this Caſe Men are not to do according to the common Cuſtom, of not calling for the Prieſt till there is little or no hope of Life left, and when his Prayers for the recovery of the Patient are almoſt as inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, as it would be to <hi>anoint him with Oil in the Name of the Lord;</hi> when he is drawing on to the laſt gaſp, and nothing indeed but a Miracle can raiſe him up. The Apoſtle does not ſay, Is any Man ſick <hi>unto Death?</hi> but, <hi>is any man ſick?</hi> which ſeems to imply an advice to call for the Elders of the Church before the Diſeaſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60864:33"/>was grown deſperate according to the natural courſe of things, and not to truſt to be Cured by a Miracle at laſt, when it was apparent that nothing but a Miracle could do it. It is now much more requiſite that the Prieſt ſhould be called for when the danger firſt begins to appear, becauſe Miracles are ceas'd. And as for them that try the Phyſician till he gives them over, and never till then ſeek the Prayers of the Church, they have but little reaſon to hope for help from God, to whom they have no recourſe till they are driven by the laſt extremity. For they ſhew, that if they could have had relief without him, they cared not to be beholden to him for it. In which Caſe it is juſt with God, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſickneſs to be mortal, which perhaps had not been ſo, if applications had been made to him with the firſt, by calling for the Elders, by confeſſing their ſins, by promiſing repentance, and by Prayers for good things requiſite, as well for the Body as the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Such admonitions as theſe we may gather from this place of Scripture; tho we do neither ſuppoſe it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to anoint <hi>ſick</hi> perſons with Oil, as they did in the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> times, unleſs we had the Gift of Healing, which flouriſhed in thoſe times; nor account it any part of our duty to anoint <hi>dying</hi> perſons with Oil, as they now do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs we belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what they ſay they believe, That it was a Sacrament inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> inſinuated by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by St. <hi>James,</hi> to confer grace and take away ſins.</p>
                  <p>But it has been ſhewn, that they give us no manner of good reaſon to believe any ſuch thing, either out of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> or St. <hi>James;</hi> but that there is very good reaſon to believe the contrary from both thoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And ſo much for their pretended Arguments out of Scripture.</p>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60864:35"/>
                  <p>Now it muſt be granted, that ſo long as the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Gift of Healing laſted, there was as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to uſe the common Ceremony of ſuch Healing as there was at firſt. And as we confeſs this practice of anointing the ſick to have been frequent in the firſt Ages of the Church, ſo we grant it to have been an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition. For we find it agreeing with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and with the Cuſtom of the Primitive Presbyters in St. <hi>James.</hi> But then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho this was the Unction of the ſick, yet it was not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, nor the Sacrament of the Dying. For the direct end for which it was adminiſtred, was, That thoſe who were anointed might not die, but recover their health by the ſupernatural Gift of God. And, as I ſhall ſhew preſently, this practice proves Antiquity to be as much againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrament, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> ſhew the Scripture to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I muſt obſerve, That there was yet another Unction in the Ancient Church, which ſeems to me to have been no otherwiſe a Religious Rite, than that it becomes <hi>Chriſtians</hi> eſpecially, who believe the Reſurrection of the Body, to interr their dead de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and honourably: For it ſeems they Anointed the Dead. So

                     <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> tells us. Nor was this to be wondered at in particular, ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> had uſed this Rite before, and the Chriſtians were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for this, That they ſpared no coſt to adorn the Funerals of thoſe who died in the Lord, as

                     <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> ſpeaks of it as of a general practice; he tells us, how the Prieſt having received the dead Body from the neareſt Relations, does all holy Rites that are Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary about thoſe that die in the Lord; that at length he ſalutes him that is dead, and that after him the reſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60864:35"/>do ſo too; that then he pours Oil upon him, and after Prayers for All, that the Body is buried. But this I think makes nothing at all for the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrament, though we ſhould take in that ſignification or inſtruction by which the laſt named Writer made this Unction of the Dead a kind of a Myſtery.
<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibid. §. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Remember,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in the holy Regeneration by which one is Born of God, that before the Divine Baptiſm, the firſt participation of that Holy Rite,</hi> viz. <hi>the anointing with Oil, is given to him that is initiated, after he has quite put off his former gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But now at the end of all, he that is departed this Life is anointed with Oil. Then indeed</hi> (before Baptiſm) <hi>the anointing with Oil called forth him that was initiated to a Holy Warfare; but now</hi> (that he is dead) <hi>the Oil that is poured upon him ſhews him that is departed out of this life to have fought in this warfare to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I grant this to be <hi>Extreme</hi> Unction; but then 'tis neither the Unction of the <hi>Dying,</hi> nor of the <hi>Sick,</hi> but of the <hi>Dead.</hi> And if the pretended Catholicks will conform to the Cuſtom of the Church in this Writers time, their Unction will not be ſo much as <hi>Extreme</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe this is to come after it; And <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s reaſon why their Unction is called <hi>Extreme,</hi> becauſe 'tis the laſt of all Unctions, will be quite out of Doors, ſince the Unction of the Dead, and not of the Dying, muſt be laſt of all.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that this <hi>Dionyſius</hi> mentions one Unction before Death; but 'tis as wide from the buſineſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrament, as that after it; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is adminiſtred only to Baptized Perſons; but the Unction he ſpeaks of which goes before death, goes before Baptiſm too, and is that which we have ſpoken of already.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the ſick in the Antient Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms our Interpretation of St.</hi> Mark <hi>and St.</hi> James.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt which I ſhall reſume, is the Antient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of anointing the <hi>ſick</hi> in the Ages next after the Apoſtles, which ſeems to be a Good Evidence of the Truth of that Interpretation of St. <hi>James,</hi> which makes his Unction of the Sick, a Rite of miraculous Healing. For this practice does of it ſelf ſhew, That in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the ancient Chriſtians thus underſtood it; becauſe they applied Unction to the ſick in order to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their health by ſupernatural means. For the forſaid Cures are all of them related as miraculous Cures.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Chemnitius</hi> had reaſon to ſay, That <hi>the progreſs of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction clearly ſhews it to be no Sacrament. For, firſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Apoſtles anointed the ſick with common Oil to heal them; then others began to add Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and to Conſecrate the Oil; but yet they uſed it to the ſame end, for which the Apoſtles uſed it before,</hi> viz. <hi>To Cure the ſick miraculouſly, as it appears by the Miracles ſaid to be done with holy Oil, by St.</hi> Martin <hi>and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>when at length Miracles were quite ceaſed, the Ceremony of anointing ſtill went on.</hi> In ſhort, he makes the Sacrament of Extreme Unction to have grown from the continuance of the Rite, after the reaſon of it was at an end, and miraculous Cures were no longer done. For which concluſion we ſhall ſee a great deal of reaſon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60864:36"/>hereafter. But in the mean time we will conſider <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>'s notable conjecture on the other ſide, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miraculous Cures that were done with Oil.
<note n="(p)" place="margin">De Extr. Unct. cap. 6. §. <hi>Quod vero,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>That the Ceremony of anointing the ſick, in the way of a Sacrament, aroſe out of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction which operated in the way of a Miracle,</hi> Chemnitius <hi>proves no otherwiſe than that himſelf ſo thinks. But we on the contrary do conjecture, that this progreſs of Oil came about another way; that is to ſay, becauſe in the Sacrament of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, it often happen'd, that people were healed; ſome holy men began upon that occaſion to uſe Oil out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not that Oil which was bleſſed by the Biſhop, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Sacrament; but Oil ſanctified by themſelves ſimply with the ſign of the Croſs, to heal Diſeaſes.</hi> Thus the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal argues.</p>
                  <p>Now if his conjecture be a good one, then by his own Confeſſion, thoſe frequent Relations which we meet with in the Ancients, of miraculous Cures by Oil, do acquaint us with an Unction very different from <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s Sacramental Unction; as of neceſſity it muſt be if the Sacramental Unction was the Mother of that. And by conſequence, unleſs they can produce other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from Antiquity for their Sacrament, they muſt not think to find it in the inſtances of thoſe that were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly healed by Oil, ſince theſe are not inſtances of Extreme Unction; nor will any Man ſay they are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be furniſhed with as bold a Face as
<note n="*" place="margin">Not. in Iren. lib. 1. c. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Fevarden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had, who without any ſcruple, makes <hi>Hilarion</hi>'s Unctions to be Extreme, and the Miracles reported to follow thereupon, to be the effects of Extreme Unction; and like an honeſt Man tells us, That St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſays ſo.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s conjecture it ſelf, which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to that of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> 'tis no better than exceſs of confidence oppoſed to plain reaſon. For this was <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>'s
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60864:37"/>ground, that all the Unction of the ſick, which we meet with in the Antients, was for bodily Cures; and that Extreme Unction was never heard of till of late; which, if it be true, makes it highly reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That <hi>Extreme</hi> Unction grew out of the <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> one, and very abſurd to ſay, that <hi>this</hi> grew from <hi>that,</hi> unleſs we could fanſy the Daughter to be born before the Mother.</p>
                  <p>As for the like Caſe which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produces in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Conjecture, I can hardly grant him what he ſeems to allow to <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> that he thought himſelf to be in the right. <hi>After this manner;</hi> ſays he, <hi>we ſee it was done in Water;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe in Baptiſm men were ſometimes healed of their Bodily Infirmities, as</hi> Auguſtin <hi>teſtifies, and gives ſome Examples of the ſame: From thence many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to uſe water, bleſſed out of Baptiſm for the Cure of Diſeaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now indeed if there had been as frequent and as early mention of this Extreme Unction in the Writings of the Antient Church, as there is of Baptiſm; and if the inſtances of Cures by Unction had been as rare as thoſe of healing by Baptiſmal Water, the inſtance had been very laudable, and one Caſe would have given light to the other: But ſince neither the one nor the other is true, nothing could have been leſs to the purpoſe. Of Baptiſm there is no diſpute, whether the Church, from the firſt, held it a Sacrament. Holy Water out of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm came in long after; and it is therefore very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to judge, That it might grow out of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, altho the Bodily Cures, wrought by Baptiſmal Water, were but rarely heard of. But now of Cures wrought by Unction, there is plain teſtimony in the Scriptures themſelves, and
<note n="‖" place="margin">Spond. A. C. 63. N. iv.</note> frequent mention in Eccleſiaſtical Writers for ſeveral Ages; And we ſay, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60864:37"/>of this pretended Sacramental Unction there was no mention, no not ſo much as any intimation, for ſeveral Ages; whilſt Bodily Cures by Oil went on abundantly. And therefore there is as much reaſon to derive the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sacrament of Unction from the miraculous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to derive the uſe of Holy Water from the Water of Baptiſm; becauſe as Baptiſm was before the one, ſo the miraculous Unction was, and that too for a much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time, before the other.</p>
                  <p>So that the Cardinal's illuſtration does him no manner of ſervice, but is as fit for our purpoſe as any that could be readily thought of. For there is no more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, whether the Antients frequently mention that Unction that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for Bodily Cures, than whether they took notice of the Sacrament of Baptiſm one Age after another, and this from the very firſt. But that they expreſſed any the leaſt regard to ſuch an Unction as the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, we utterly deny. And therefore for the ſame reaſon, that Water bleſſed for Bodily Cures, ſprang from the Water of Baptiſm, which is a Sacrament; for the ſame reaſon, I ſay, we may conclude, That Extreme Unction, which is pretended to be a Sacrament, but is none, ſprang from the Unction which was for Bodily Cures, and which was not pretended to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But the main point to be obſerved in this place, is, That if in the Antient Church they ſtill anointed the ſick in order to a miraculous Cure, and never applied Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as a Sacrament to prepare the Soul for its conflict with Death, and to purge away the Reliques of ſin; this is little leſs than a demonſtration, that they did not underſtand St. <hi>James,</hi> as ſpeaking of Sacramental, or Extreme Unction, but of that Unction which was to reſtore health to the Body.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60864:38"/>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore proceed to ſhew, that Antiquity was wholly a ſtranger to the <hi>Roman</hi> myſtery of anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick; and the firſt thing I ſhall attempt to this purpoſe, is to anſwer thoſe few teſtimonies which our Adverſaries pretend to have on their ſide.</p>

But for what is added, 'tis a needleſs doubt, whether a Biſhop may do that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly lawful for Presbyters. For Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are therefore mentioned, becauſe Biſhops being hindred by other imployments, cannot go about to all ſick perſons. But if the Biſhop can, or thinks fit to viſit any one, he that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60864:39"/>made the Chriſme it ſelf, may without all ſcruple, bleſs and anoint with it. But the Chriſme is not to be given to Penitents, becauſe 'tis a kind of a Sacrament: For how can one kind of a Sacrament be allowed to thoſe to whom the reſt are denied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here indeed is a Reſolution of ſome Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Unction of the ſick; but to fanſy, that what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, was the ſubject of this place, is ſo wild an Imagination, that altho <hi>All the Catholicks</hi> have entertain'd it, I cannot but wonder how it ſhould enter into any wiſe man's head. For 'tis in effect to ſay, That altho this Unction was a Sacrament pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by St. <hi>James,</hi> and had been applied to the ſick conſtantly for above three hundred years; yet there was a certain Biſhop well eſteemed by his Holineſs, who was ſo Uncatechized, that he neither knew who might receive this Sacrament, nor who might give it. I acknowledge, that if this be <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Epiſtle, I have made a little bold with him upon the account of his groſs miſtakes in it. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the reſt of his <hi>Catholicks,</hi> repreſent him ten times worſe; and in plain terms they abuſe him. And therefore here I muſt be the Pope's Advocate, and do him ſo much right, as to ſay, That if the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> had been ſo ſtupidly ignorant, who were to receive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, and who were to apply it; yet at leaſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he conſulted in the Caſe, would have wondered at it a little, inſtead of giving him ſuch cool and formal Anſwers, as if <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had ſtarted ſome new difficulties which before his time there was no occaſion to inquire about: Unleſs they will make Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> as ignorant as the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be. But tho the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60864:40"/>Pope was ſo egregiouſly miſtaken in the Hiſtory of the propagation of the Goſpel over the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of the World, and in the Diſcipline of the Church concerning Faſting days; yet that he ſhould be ignorant too of the uſe of one of the proper Sacraments of the Church, till <hi>Decentius</hi> gave him occaſion to inform himſelf better, is an imputation no leſs incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible in it ſelf, than reproachful to him. This ought not by any means to be believed of a <hi>learned man and a holy,</hi> and one <hi>wonderfully commended by</hi> Auſtin, Hierom, <hi>and</hi> Chryſoſtom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed would perſuade us, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop inquired only,
<note n="(w)" place="margin">Ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. §. <hi>Ex hoc etiam.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Whether a Biſhop might give the Sacrament of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, or a Presbyter only.</hi> A very fine Queſtion for a Biſhop to ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> if that were all? But, by his leave, <hi>Decentius</hi> asked more queſtions than ſo, or elſe the Pope ran out in his Anſwer very impertinently; and that he inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſomething farther, is very evident from his own words, who coming to that point, ſays,

                     </note> 
                     <hi>But for what is added, your doubt is needleſs,</hi> &amp;c. which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly implies, that there were other doubts; to which that was <hi>added</hi> concerning the power of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to anoint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as indeed there was one or two before it, and another after it. So that they make this entercourſe between <hi>Decentius</hi> and <hi>Innocentius,</hi> to be juſt as if one of the Biſhops of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhould write to the preſent Pope, to know whether Extreme Unction might be given to the faithful in their ſickneſs, whether they might anoint themſelves, whether a Biſhop might anoint them, and (as I ſhall preſently ſhew the Caſe to be the ſame) whether Excommunicated perſons, in no danger of death, might be anointed as well as the reſt; and the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60864:40"/>Pope ſhould make ſuch an Anſwer as <hi>Innocent</hi> did. For if Extreme Unction was then underſtood and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the Church, as it is now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe two antient Biſhops were altogether as ridiculous, as his Holineſs and ſome other Biſhop now would be upon ſuch a ſuppoſition.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> cannot be meant in this place; and which makes this pretended teſtimony for it come off very miſerably; we need not deſire a better Argument, that in thoſe dayes the Church knew nothing at all of the now <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine or practiſe of that Unction; for if it was then as 'tis now, theſe two antients talked of the matter before them like a couple of Ideots, and were ſo far from deſerving to be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that they were not worthy to be accounted <hi>Novices</hi> in Chriſtianity; which will more fully appear by a brief account of the Pope's <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,</hi> and the <hi>Queſtions</hi> which <hi>they</hi> ſuppoſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to have ſent.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſeen, that the pretended Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Unction, cannot be the ſubject of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in that Epiſtle; And the reaſons already of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered make it neceſſary to ſuppoſe, that it was ſome new thing that had not been formerly thought of in the Church. Nor do we need to go far for a Key to unlock this myſtery, ſince the place it ſelf affords one, which is this, That the Inquiries of <hi>Decentius,</hi> and the Pope's Anſwers, went all upon the <hi>Oil of Chriſme,</hi> which <hi>Oil</hi> (by the way) is not the matter of the late Sacrament of Unction; it being compounded Oil that was kept in the Church for anointing, not the ſick, but thoſe that were in health, that is to ſay, newly Baptized perſons, and ſuch as were made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

<note n="(x)" place="margin">De Extr. Unct. p. 100.</note> Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi>'s Conjecture; which is this. <q>'Tis very likely, that ſome who obſerved, that Diſeaſes were by ſeveral miraculouſly cured, and this by applying Oil, and had read in St. <hi>James</hi> thoſe words, <hi>Is any one ſick,</hi> &amp;c. being ſick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deſired of <hi>Decentius,</hi> that they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the <hi>Chriſm,</hi> which they knew to be in the Church, not knowing but by this means they might be healed; and thereupon that <hi>Decentius</hi> inquired of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> what was in this caſe fit to be done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which it may not be unfit to add, That as the Gift of Healing continued hitherto in the Church, ſo neither had all Presbyters that Gift, nor only they; nor was it exerted at the pleaſure of thoſe that had it; and therefore ſince the Rite of Anointing the ſick with Oil, went along with the uſe of the Gift, neither could the ſick expect to be anointed upon their deſire, either by the Presbyters that had not the Gift, or by thoſe, or any others, that had it. Which I ſay to prevent that Objection againſt Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi>'s Conjecture; That probably the ſick would rather have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60864:42"/>deſired the Prieſts to anoint them with Oil, or ſome others that had the Gift of Healing ſo to do, than to be anointed with <hi>Chriſm:</hi> For there is no ground for this at all, unleſs it had been part of the Prieſtly office to anoint the ſick, as it is now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; or unleſs they that had the Gift of Healing by Oil, could have exerted it when they pleaſed. And therefore it is reaſonable to ſay, That as it is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of People in diſtreſs to try every way they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to think of which flatters them into hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſo thoſe ſick Perſons who could not demand that Unction which accompanied the Supernatural Gift of Healing, yet at leaſt deſired to try what might be done by the uſe of the holy <hi>Chriſm</hi> that was reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church for other purpoſes, not knowing but that the effect promiſed in S. <hi>James</hi> to the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> might follow it.</p>
                  <p>But whatever the <hi>occaſion</hi> was, the uſe of <hi>Chriſm</hi> to a new purpoſe, was the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the Inquiry; And the ground upon which <hi>Decentius</hi> went, was, that the Text was to be underſtood of the Faithful that were ſick, as <hi>Innocent</hi> acknowledged; and hereupon as it ſhould ſeem by the Anſwers of the later, the Queſtions of the former were theſe Four:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether the Faithful that were ſick might be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chriſm?</hi> To which the Pope anſwered, That <hi>they might.</hi> Now if by <hi>Chriſm,</hi> was meant what they call the <hi>Sacrament of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and what they ſuppoſe was acknowledged by both of them and by the whole Church in thoſe days; it was a very ſenſleſs Queſtion, and as ſenſleſs an Anſwer; and it might as well have been asked by the one, Whether the Faithful may receive the Euchariſt, and ſay their Prayers, and do what is their duty to do? and as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60864:43"/>gravely anſwered by the other, That they might. But there is ſome ſenſe in it, if we underſtand the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the applying of that <hi>Chriſm</hi> to the ſick, which was hitherto uſed in the Church for other purpoſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether the ſick might in their need anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it.</hi> To which the Pope anſwered, That <hi>they might;</hi> For, ſays he, <hi>Not only Prieſts, but all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may lawfully uſe in their own need, or in theirs who belong to them, the Oil of Chriſm prepared by the Biſhop, and anoint with it.</hi> Now if this was meant of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction, it argued great ſtupidity in <hi>Decentius</hi> to inquire whether Lay-Chriſtians might Adminiſter a Sacrament to themſelves and to others, which it was lawful for none to Adminiſter, but a Presbyter at leaſt, as we are told by the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> And in the Pope it was unpardonable Ignorance to determin this Queſtion the wrong way, by allowing that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might uſe this Sacrament, by Anointing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Friends with it. But if we underſtand the uſe of <hi>Chriſm</hi> in order to Healing, there was ſome reaſon for this Queſtion, ſince on the one ſide the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſe of <hi>Chriſm</hi> was applied only by Perſons in Orders, on the other ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e it was known that ſuch as were not in Orders, had with ſucceſs applied Oil to the Cure of the Sick; ſo that there was an appearance of Reaſon on both ſides to move <hi>Decentius</hi> to ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if the Faithful might be anointed with <hi>Chriſm</hi> in their ſickneſs, the Laity might anoint themſelves and others with it, as the Laity that had the Gift of Healing anointed with Oil? or whether they muſt leave it to the Prieſt, becauſe it was <hi>Chriſm.</hi> And <hi>Innocent</hi> in my opinion anſwered very well, that he knew nothing to the contrary, but they might do it themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60864:43"/>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>If they might not Anoint themſelves with it, it being clear from S.</hi> James, <hi>that Presbyters had power to Anoint the Sick, Whether Biſhops were included or not?</hi> Now this ſeems to me to be no overwiſe Queſtion, let the ſuppoſition upon which 'tis asked be what it will. But if Extreme Unction went then in the Church, as it does now in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, the Queſtion was exceedingly fooliſh; for we are told that the
<note n="(y)" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 14. cap. 3.</note> Miniſters of this Sacrament are Biſhops, or Prieſts rightly ordained by Biſhops. And, to ſet that aſide; who can imagin that a Biſhop ſhould doubt, whether a Biſhop had power to Adminiſter one of the Sacraments of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution? But though 'tis hard to ſay what came into his Head to move this Queſtion about the Biſhop's power to Anoint the <hi>Sick with Chriſm,</hi> yet the whole buſineſs being new, and he believing that it was to be governed by the Text of S. <hi>James,</hi> it was nothing near ſo extravagant a Queſtion, as it had been upon the ſuppoſition of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction: Though indeed it was ſomething odd if we take it as it is; And therefore the Pope gave him a gentle gird for it, in theſe words: <hi>But for what is added, 'tis a needleſs doubt, Whether a Biſhop may do that which is undoubtedly lawful for Presbyters?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Whether the Chriſm might be given to Penitents in their Sickneſs?</hi> Now if <hi>Chriſm</hi> had been the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, 'tis not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Decentius</hi> ſhould have asked ſuch a Queſtion as this. For if by the Sick, to be anointed, he had meant only the dying, there had been no room for that Queſtion, Whether <hi>ſick,</hi> i. e. <hi>dying</hi> Penitents might be anointed, it being a notorious cuſtom of the Church
<note n="*" place="margin">Innoc. Ep. III. n. 2.</note> in thoſe days to communicate thoſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Penance, if they were in evident danger of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60864:44"/>Death. But 'tis evident, that both <hi>Decentius</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> ſpake of all that were viſited with Sickneſs, though in appearance the Sickneſs were not mortal, (for <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſpeaks ſimply of the Sick, and ſays that the Biſhop cannot viſit all the Sick, and the like.) And the Queſtion thus taken, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether all ſick Penitents might be anointed, was a very ignorant Queſtion, if he meant <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was notorious that they who were in the ſtate of <hi>Penitents,</hi> were denied all manner of Sacraments, (unleſs in the Article of Death) as <hi>Innocent</hi> obſerved in his Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That <hi>Decentius</hi> bewraied as much ignorance, if he put this Queſtion concerning the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſick Penitents, with proper <hi>Chriſm,</hi> ſince <hi>Innocentius</hi> anſwering in the <hi>Negative,</hi> thought fit to give this reaſon for his Anſwer, That <hi>all Sacraments were denied to Penitents.</hi> I Anſwer, That there was a reaſonable ground upon which <hi>Decentius</hi> might move ſuch a Queſtion; For though <hi>Chriſm</hi> was eſteemed a kind of Sacrament, yet whether it might not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for the recovery of their bodily health, to whom Sacraments were yet denied, was a doubt which a wiſe Man might make. For ſince the Sick in that place deſired to try the ſucceſs of being anointed with <hi>Chriſm,</hi> in order to the ſame effect that they knew anointing with Oil, by thoſe that had the Gift of Healing, produced upon ſick Perſons; it might be thought that this uſe of <hi>Chriſm,</hi> juſt now ſtarted, might be exempted from the common Rule, eſpecially becauſe there were inſtances of ſome cured by Oil
<note n="†" place="margin">Spondan. A. C. 63. N. IV.</note> that were not ſo much as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And though <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> concluded in the <hi>Negative,</hi> yet the Queſtion would have born a Diſpute in behalf of the Penitents,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60864:44"/>if upon trial of the virtue of holy <hi>Chriſm</hi> to cure the Sick, the matter had been found to deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>And here we are come to the place upon which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> triumphs, as if <hi>Innocentius</hi>'s Teſtimony alone would do the buſineſs. <hi>He ſays expreſly and clearly,</hi> ſays the Cardinal, <hi>That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction is a Sacrament explain'd by S.</hi> James, <hi>and therefore not to be given to thoſe who are not capable of other Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. What a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſerve the turn, where there is a good will, but no manner of good reaſon for the Concluſion! <hi>That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction is a Sacrament?</hi> What Unction I pray? Not <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction:</hi> for of that he ſpeaks not a word; and as I have abundantly ſhewn, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> cannot be underſtood as ſpeaking of that, by any Man that has a grain of ſenſe, and is withal as honeſt as he ſhould be. But here lies the ſecret, that there is mention of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and that of the Sick too, and moreover that there is the word <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and ſo without any more to do, it muſt be the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> that is ſpoken of, as if no other account were to be given of the place. But let the place it ſelf be produced, which <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (to be even with him for his cenſure of <hi>Chemnuius</hi>) was <hi>afraid</hi> to produce; and the impertinence of appealing to it, will immediately appear. <hi>But the Chriſm is not to be given to Penitents, becauſe 'tis a KIND of a Sacrament. For how can one kind of a Sacrament be allowed to thoſe, to whom the reſt are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied?</hi> By which 'tis evident that 'tis not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the <hi>Sick,</hi> much leſs <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the Sick, but the very <hi>Chriſm</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Chriſm</hi> I ſay which had been bleſſed by the Biſhop, that <hi>Innocent</hi> calls a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With <hi>this Sacrament</hi> they anointed thoſe that were baptized, that were ordained Prieſts, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Biſhops; And the applying of it to the Sick
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60864:45"/>made it not one jot more a Sacrament, than it was before. But then how does he ſtile it a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Far enough I am ſure from <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s purpoſe. He ſays, <hi>'tis a kind of a Sacrament.</hi> Now that which is a <hi>kind of a Sacrament,</hi> is not a Sacrament properly ſo called, ſuch as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> are, but that which in ſome reſpect may be ſo called. And many ſuch Sacraments there were in thoſe times, more than ſeven times ſeven, as every Man knows that is verſed in the Antients. Every ſign of a holy thing, every thing bleſſed to a Religious uſe, and not only the Ceremonies of the Chriſtian Church, but ſometimes the myſteries of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the Types of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that were amongſt the Iſraelites, were called Sacraments.

                     <hi>have not many Teſtimonies of this kind, that is, ſo antient and ſo expreſs, as this is; becauſe</hi> the Antients <hi>had not occaſion to write of this matter.</hi> That they had no occaſion to write of Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is undoubtedly true; for there could be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to write of a thing that was never dream'd of till ſome hundreds of years after. But if this be the moſt antient and expreſs Teſtimony they have, it had been better for them that <hi>Decentius</hi> had never conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Innocentius</hi> about anointing the Sick with <hi>Chriſm,</hi> that they might have had no occaſion of appealing to thus much Antiquity for <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> by which, if that be a thing they care for, they have expoſed themſelves to open ſhame.</p>
                  <p>But now it may be expected that <hi>Innocent</hi> III. for coming ſo ſhort of the other in point of Antiquity, ſhould at leaſt make amends for that, by the plainneſs and expreſneſs of his Teſtimony.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60864:46"/>that Pope himſelf expreſſing his own mind in the place to which the Cardinal refers us. For neither can I, nor, I am confident, did he find more in it, than this, that the Pope having diſtinguiſhed between the <hi>inward</hi> and the <hi>outward</hi> Unction, <hi>quoted</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> for the later, and then tells us, That

And the truth is, the great buſineſs of that Chapter is to explain the myſtery of anointing Biſhops. So that one would wonder why the Cardinal ſhould pretend that even this Pope's teſtimony is given <hi>largely</hi> and <hi>clearly:</hi> though if it had, the teſtimony had been very impertinent, ſince it is no proof at all that Extreme Unction ſtands upon the <hi>Tradition of the Antients.</hi> For this Pope lived in the thirteenth Age, as we obſerved before, was a Man as degenerate from the Antient Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Age in which he lived was from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times; He was a Depoſer of Princes, and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible perſecutor of Gods ſervants; nor is his teſtimony, what ever it had been, worth conſidering, but only to ſhew that the zealous Men of that Church, are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to want Authorities, though there are none to be had.

                  <p>The truth is, this ſixty ninth Canon is a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh one, and altogether unworthy of thoſe Fathers. It ſhews how they are to be reconciled that were led from the Faith by Fornication with Infidels, <hi>viz.</hi> amongſt other things, by ſprinkling them with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Oyl bleſſed, <hi>as water is bleſſed for the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their uncleanneſs, who had eaten any thing that died of it ſelf.</hi> What ſtuff is this?</p>
                  <p>And yet this worthy Canon cannot be made to ſpeak for that purpoſe for which 'tis brought; for it ſays, <hi>the Prieſt muſt bleſs Water and Oyl, not as 'tis bleſſed in Baptiſm, nor as Chriſm is bleſſed, but as the Oyl of the Sick is bleſſed, and as Water is bleſſed for the purifying,</hi> &amp;c. But does it ſay that the Oyl of the Sick is bleſſed for <hi>Sacramental</hi> Unction of the Sick? No more, I aſſure you, than that Water is bleſſed for the <hi>Sacramental</hi> purification of thoſe that had eaten Carrion. In a word here is no mention ſo much as of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> which at leaſt had been neceſſary, to make this teſtimony worth any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. But 'tis a misfortune that will ſome times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; to bring forth a Forgery, and to get nothing by it.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal having made all ſure by a General Council, tells us, that they <hi>have particular Councils too,</hi> but then they <hi>are Antient</hi> ones, he ſays; And yet not ſo <hi>Antient,</hi> neither. For the firſt he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the ſecond Synod of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>lon</hi> which was held in the ninth Age; and therefore at too great a diſtance from the beginning, to prove a Sacrament by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Antients.</hi> But however let us hear the Canon to which we are referred:
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Can. 48. Tom. 7. Labb.</note> 
                     <hi>According to the Inſtruction of S.</hi> James, <hi>with which alſo the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Fathers do agree, the Sick ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60864:47"/>by the Presbyters, with Oyl that is bleſſed by the Biſhops. For ſo he ſays, Is any one Sick,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this kind of Medicine is not to be undervalued, which heals the diſtempers of Soul and Body.</hi> The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals gloſs upon this Canon, is, that <hi>the Council ſpeaking of this Sacrament ſays, that the Decrees of the Fathers are conſonant to the Epiſtle of S.</hi> James. But he did very well to ſuppreſs the words of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non it ſelf; for otherwiſe it had been evident that it does not ſpeak of <hi>his Sacrament,</hi> as he, of his own head, ſays it does: For indeed it ſpeaks of no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all; the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> at which elſewhere he is ſo ready to take advantage, being not ſo much as here mentioned. Moreover that Unction of which this Synod ſpake, was for healing the diſtempers of the Body, and therefore very different from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Unction, which is principally for thoſe that are drawing on to the laſt gaſp. And as for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the Soul which it was ſaid to heal too, there is no reaſon that the Synod ſhould be interpreted otherwiſe, than according to the Text which they cited; where 'tis ſaid, <hi>If he hath committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him:</hi> that is to ſay, that the firſt and conſtant intention in Unction of the Sick, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Bodies, and in ſome caſes it would alſo be beneficial to their Souls.</p>
                  <p>But by this time I grant there was a certain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of anointing the Sick, ſlipt into the Church, ſomething different from the judgment and practice of more antient times, but withal a great deal more different from the modern doctrine and practice of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I ſhall ſhew more particularly in its proper place, and that although thus much Antiquity comes too late to conclude us
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60864:48"/>in points wherein it was ſingular, yet it does effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally condemn the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in points wherein it was not ſo, becauſe it ſhews the lateneſs of <hi>their</hi> Innovations.</p>
                  <p>As for the Synod of <hi>Worms</hi> held in the year 868, which he next mentions; he confeſſes that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non he refers to, renews the Decree of <hi>Innocentius.</hi> The truth is, that Canon does word for word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all that paſſage in the Epiſtle of <hi>Innocentius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 72.</note> which we have conſidered before, and this without the leaſt Preface to it, or Note upon it. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of being a Teſtimony to Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is a good Argument that thoſe Fathers knew no more of it, than the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubium</hi> did above 400 years before.</p>
                  <p>He cites alſo a Canon of a Synod at <hi>Meaux</hi> out of <hi>Burchardus,</hi> commanding that <hi>upon Good-Friday Eve the Rectors of Pariſhes ſhould receive a Glaſs of holy Oyl from the Biſhop for the anointing of the Sick, according to Apoſtolical Tradition.</hi> Now whether there ever was ſuch a Canon made at <hi>Meaux</hi> or not, 'tis all one to us; for that it was now the cuſtom to anoint all Sick perſons, we readily grant, but that it was either Extreme or Sacramental Unction, we flatly deny; nor is there a word to that purpoſe in the Canon now cited.</p>
                  <p>The next is the ſecond Synod of <hi>Aken</hi>
                     <note n="(e)" place="margin">Aquiſgr. 2. Cap. 2. §. 1. Can. 8.</note>, which requires that once a Year the Biſhops in all Cities do not neglect the Benediction of Holy Oil,

                     <hi>wherein the relief of ſick Perſons is believed to be.</hi> What ſays <hi>Bellarmin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this? <hi>The Canon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>requires, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament be not neglected, in which the Salvation of the Sick is contained.</hi> But does it ſpeak of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> or of <hi>Sacramental <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction?</hi> Yes, they will ſay,

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in <hi>which the Salvation of the Sick is contained;</hi> But the Canon does not ſay as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> does, but that the Health or Salvation of the Sick is <hi>believed</hi> to be in that Unction; which is as much as to ſay, that their Unction was believed to be very profitable towards the recovery of a ſick Mans Health. And that this was the meaning of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, appears from their inſtructions to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the care they ought to have of the Sick, which is expreſſed in theſe words,

                     <hi>But if he</hi> [his Pariſhioner] <hi>be grieved with Sickneſs, let him not by his</hi> [the Presbyters] <hi>negligence want Confeſſion, and the Prayer of the Prieſt, or the Anointing of holy Oil.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>If he perceives his end approaching, let him commend the Chriſtian Soul, as a Prieſt ſhould do, to the Lord his God, with the reception of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and his Body to be buried in a Chriſtian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> By which you ſee there are two ſtates of the ſick Perſon conſidered, one when he is <hi>depreſt by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the other when he <hi>is drawing to his end;</hi> And that the Anointing with Oil is preſcribed as proper to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> while good hope of life laſted; not to the latter, as 'tis now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he ſeemed to be near his end; For in that caſe they preſcribed the Adminiſtration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Which ſhews that by <hi>believing the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Health of the Sick to be in</hi> Unction; which they had obſerved not long before, they meant the common belief of the profitableneſs of Unction to raiſe up the Sick, and to reſtore him to Health. For if they had taken Unction to be the <hi>Sacrament of the dying,</hi> according to the new Divinity of the <hi>Trent</hi>-Synod, they alſo would have preſcribed Unction in that caſe wherein 'tis plain they did not preſcribe it,

                  <p>To conclude, whereas the Cardinal affirms, That the Council of <hi>Mentz</hi> under <hi>Rabanus, affirms like things;</hi> I do acknowledge that in this he ſays the truth, for they require

                  <p>The firſt he refers to, is <hi>Origen</hi>'s ſecond <hi>Homily</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus;</hi> where there are ſeven ways laid down of obtaining remiſſion of ſins; the ſeventh being expreſſed in that paſſage which the Cardinal meant. The words are theſe:
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Ultra med.</note> 
                     <hi>There is yet a ſeventh way, though it be hard and painful; when the ſinner waſhes his Bed with tears, and tears are his meat day and night, and when he is not aſhamed to ſhow his ſin to the Prieſt of the Lord, and to ſeek for Healing, according to him who ſaith, I ſaid I will confeſs againſt my ſelf my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the ungodlineſs of my heart. In which alſo is fulfilled that which the Apoſtle ſaith, Is any man ſick, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60864:50"/>lay their hands upon him, anointing him with Oil in the Name of the Lord, and the Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Now here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Origen</hi> ſays, that in the <hi>Penitence</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, in order to the <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> that Text of S. <hi>James</hi> was fulfilled. Which is ſo far from being an Argument that he underſtood the Text of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> that 'tis a good Argument of the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for 'tis manifeſt that he does not apply the Text to the caſe of a dying, or ſo much as a ſick Perſon; but in general to the caſe of a ſinner that anxiouſly ſeeks for Pardon, and is willing to undergo that hard and painful Penitence which he deſcribed. If therefore the Cardinal's meaning by this Teſtimony was to prove that <hi>Origen</hi> believed all was to be done in every Age which S. <hi>James</hi> directs, and in particular the <hi>anointing with Oil;</hi> then he muſt needs ſuppoſe that in <hi>Origen</hi>'s opinion S. <hi>James</hi> directed the anointing of <hi>Penitents,</hi> without any regard at all to a ſtate of Health or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But if <hi>Origen</hi> had thought ſo, I dare ſay that he, (whatever the Cardinal might ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> done) would not have called this Unction, either the Sacrament of the dying, or Extreme Unction, or ſo much as the Unction of the Sick. Could any thing be more abſurd than to pretend that this great Man produced S. <hi>James</hi>'s Text in favour of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> which is always of the ſick or the dying; when the Perſons to whom he applied it, and who were to be anointed, if he ſpeaks of any that were to be ſo, might every one of them be in good and perfect Health?

                     <hi>this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as it were a kind of Penance of the Sick, who cannot do works of Penance.</hi> But 'tis plain that thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom <hi>Origen</hi> applied the Text of S. <hi>James,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60864:50"/>were thoſe that did works of Penance, and that a <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>laborious</hi> Penance too. It is not for nothing that the Cardinal does ſo often refer his Reader to Authorities, without producing the words themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So that this Authority is groſly impertinent to the purpoſe for which 'tis brought; and though

I Anſwer, Firſt, That although this Text was produced, yet it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that <hi>Origen</hi> did not mean all was fulfilled that is there ſaid, but only ſome part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That which concerned calling for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and deſiring his Prayers, and obtaining Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins, to which we are to add, <hi>Confeſſing of Faults,</hi> though he did not cite the Text ſo far. For that all ſhould be fulfilled in the proper ſenſe, by doing what he preſcribed, is unconceivable; for to <hi>weep,</hi> and to <hi>confeſs,</hi> &amp;c. is not <hi>to be anointed with Oil.</hi> I ſay therefore <hi>Origen</hi> might reſer to ſome ſpecial paſſages in that Text, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which might be well accommodated to his preſont purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Or, Secondly, According to the ingenious conjecture of Mr. <hi>Daillé, Origen</hi> allegorized this place after his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, making the ſick Man the Type of the ſinner.
<note n="(m)" place="margin">Ubi ſupra, §. 93.</note> 
                     <hi>As in S.</hi> James, <hi>the ſick calls for the Presbyters, ſo here the ſinner goes to the ſame. There the ſick is anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Oil. Here the ſinner is beſmear'd with his own Tears, and as it were with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of Penitence. There the ſick Man is healed; here alſo the ſinner is reſtored. And therefore</hi> Origen <hi>affirms that to be fulfilled
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60864:51"/>in the one, which S.</hi> James <hi>affirmed properly and literally of the other. For every one knows, that as often as that is done which was expreſſed by a Type, ſo often the Type is ſaid to be fulfilled.</hi> Which ſuppoſition is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe in this Homily, that great Man's hand was in at <hi>Allegorizing:</hi> for there the Reader may find, that he diſcovered his ſeven ways of coming to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs in the Sacrifices of the Law. But whatever his meaning was, one thing is certain, that he did not mean <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction:</hi> And that is all we need to be ſure of at preſent.</p>
                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe is
<note n="(n)" place="margin">De Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotio, L. III. c. 6.</note> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> quoted in the next place, but not a word produced that he ſays. For, indeed, he brings in the Text of S. <hi>James</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that Prieſtly Dignity and Power which he was ſpeaking of; how available it is to obtain forgiveneſs of ſins for us not only in Baptiſm at firſt, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by Diſcipline, Inſtruction and Prayers. But of the caſe of a dying or ſick Perſon he ſays not one word; which ſhews plainly enough that he produced the whole Text for the ſake only of the latter part of it which expreſſeth <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> and that he thought this part of the Text might be underſtood of the <hi>power of the Keys,</hi> which was the ſubject of his diſcourſe, both before and after the mentioning of this Text.</p>
                  <p>As little to the purpoſe is it, either that he found this Text quoted in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s

For though S. <hi>James</hi>'s Text is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet 'tis to exhort the ſick to <hi>anoint his own Body</hi> with Oil, that the Church was to furniſh them withal, inſtead of going to Inchanters, Wizards, Soothſayers, and uſing Devilliſh arts to recover his Health.

                     <hi>Bede</hi> is mentioned next, who in his Notes upon <hi>James</hi> V. ſpeaking of the Unction there, hath theſe words: <hi>And we read in the Goſpel that the Apoſtle alſo did this, and now the cuſtom of the Church is that the Sick ſhould be anointed with conſecrated Oyl by the Biſhops, and be healed thereby together with Prayer. Nor is it only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Presbyters, but as Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>writeth, for all Chriſtians alſo to anoint themſelves or their friends with it in their need.</hi> So that <hi>Bede</hi> makes the Unction of S. <hi>James,</hi> to be the ſame with that of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and that of the Church the ſame with both; the recovery of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health, being the end of all three; than which there could not be expected a better Teſtimony againſt Etreme Unction. But by this time we are ſo well uſed to the Cardinals Authorities, that we ought to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at nothing.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Theophylact</hi> in the eleventh Age, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſends us to his Notes upon S. <hi>Mark,</hi> where indeed he takes occaſion alſo to repeat the place of S. <hi>James,</hi> and from thence to ſhew the ſeveral ſignifications of anointing with Oyl; but of Extreme Unction, no, nor ſo much as of anointing the Sick, he ſaith not a word.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon the <hi>Vth.</hi> of S. <hi>James,</hi> tells us, That <hi>whileſt our Lord converſed with Men, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did the ſame thing, anointing the Sick with Oyl, and healing them.</hi> And therefore according to <hi>Oecumenius</hi> 'tis impoſſible to prove <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> from S. <hi>James,</hi> which is not a Rite of <hi>healing the Sick,</hi> but the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Dying.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond ſett of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s <hi>Fathers,</hi> are thoſe that

                     <hi>expreſly number this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction amongſt the Sacraments,</hi> that is to ſay, they call <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Sick, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to which I have already ſaid that if every Rite and Ceremony, to which Antient Writers have given the name of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> muſt go for a Sacrament properly ſo called, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt mend her Councils and Catechiſms, and multiply Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments exceedingly. But who are thoſe Fathers? The moſt antient that he names is <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> who lived in the later end of the 8th. Age, and the beginning of the 9th. He was Scholar to Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> and if in this matter he learned of his Maſter, we are ſecure enough that his Authority will do us no harm. But whether it would or not, we ſhall never learn from that
<note n="†" place="margin">De divinis Officiis cap. 47.49.</note> Book to which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> refers us, becauſe it was none of his, but the work of a much later Writer, as <hi>Quercetanus</hi> has ſhewn in the Preface to the Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Alcuinus.</hi> But what is worſt of all, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this Author, whoever he was, though it proves <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the Sick to be cuſtomary in his days, yet proves as clearly that <hi>Extreme</hi> Unction was not. For he diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>Sick</hi> and the <hi>Dying,</hi> ſhewing that the Sick indeed were anointed, but not thoſe that were in extremedanger of Death, for which there was very good reaſon, ſince, even in thoſe days Unction was uſed in order to bodily health, but not as a Sacrament to fortifie the Soul in her paſſage out of this Life. For a more particular account of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I refer the Reader to
<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ubi ſupra p. 119. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amalarius</hi> comes next, whoſe judgment concerning the uſe and end of that Unction which S. <hi>James</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have already ſeen [<hi>P.</hi> 1. §. 5.] and that in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60864:53"/>the very
<note n="*" place="margin">De Offic. Eccl. lib. 1. cap. 12.</note> place to which the Cardinal refers us. This Writer does accordingly make the Unction of his time to be a <hi>Remedy of ſickneſs;</hi> and therefore they may as well make Life and Death to be one and the ſame thing, as have the confidence to make the Unction of <hi>Amalarius</hi> Extreme Unction.</p>
                  <p>And now we are brought to the borders of the Twelfth Age; for his next <hi>Father</hi> is Cardinal <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani,</hi> who is yet far enough from acknowledging this Sacrament of Extreme Unction: For though he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes ſpiritual effects to that Unction mentioned by S. <hi>James,</hi> yet he ſays, <hi>health is reſtored by it;</hi> and though he calls it a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet he makes it to be a
<note n="†" place="margin">Unde &amp; Sancti Patres hanc Unctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum eſſe ſanxerunt.</note> 
                     <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed by the Fathers, i.e.</hi> a Rite which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought deſerved the name of a Sacrament, no leſs than many others, which yet were not of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or univerſal and neceſſary obligation. And that this was his meaning, cannot, I think, reaſonably be denied by our Adverſaries, ſince he makes <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of the Sick,</hi> not to be one of <hi>Seven,</hi> but of <hi>Twelve</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which he reckons up in that place.</p>
                  <p>But to make ſure of ſome body, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> goes on to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Father <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore,</hi> and Father <hi>Lombard,</hi> who, I acknowledge, began to ſpeak of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sick as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does now. But then I cannot allow theſe to be <hi>Antient</hi> Fathers, for they were all Men of the Twelfth Age. And it is more than enough for us, that the great Cardinal having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to prove <hi>by the Tradition of the Antients,</hi> that Extreme Unction is a Sacrament, has not been able to produce ſo much as one pertinent Teſtimony for it, of <hi>Pope, Council</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> for above a thouſand years after <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>THough ſo great a failing is of it ſelf a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inducement to believe, that Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was utterly unknown to Antiquity, yet there are many more evidences of it; which it may be worth the while to produce, if it be but to reprove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our Adverſaries, and to ſhew that they who make the greateſt noiſe of Antient Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, have the leaſt cauſe for it of all other Chriſtians in the World.

<note n="*" place="margin">De Extr. Unc.

                  <p>In the firſt place; there is not the leaſt mention of this pretended Sacrament in <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian</hi> or <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 61.62.</note> nor in any of the Writers of the Three firſt Ages, who yet diſcourſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and plainly of the Diſcipline and the Sacraments of the Chriſtian Church; and therefore it was not known to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither was it known in the Fourth Age, which afforded ſo many Chriſtian Writers, ſince not one of them mentions it, no not in treating upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rites of the Church: which had been as unpardonable negligence in them, if they had believed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60864:54"/>any ſuch Sacrament as this, as it would be now in the Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to omit Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction when they pretend to give an account of the Sacraments.
<note place="margin">P. 62, 63.</note> 
                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> largely treats of the Doctrins, Rites, and Diſciplines of the Church, in the cloſe of his work againſt Hereſies, and has not a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction. The Countefeit <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in his <hi>Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> does with wonderful exactneſs and curioſity lay down all the myſteries of the Church from the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to the Funerals of the Faithful; but of Extreme Unction he is altogether ſilent. And ſo is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitutions,</hi> in his Eighth Book, where he undertakes to declare all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Forms</hi> whatſoever.</p>

That for the firſt fix Ages, though the manner and circumſtances of the Deaths of many holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were deſcribed very particularly by the Writers of thoſe times, yet there is not the leaſt intimation that ſo much as any one of them was anointed. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> mentions it not of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or <hi>Helen;</hi> Nor <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>Anthony;</hi> Nor <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> of his Siſter <hi>Gorgonia,</hi>

                  <p>On the other hand in theſe later Ages, the Extreme Unction of thoſe who dye in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and have their Lives and Deaths written afterward, is ſeldom or never omitted, as appears by a vaſt number
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60864:54"/>of Inſtances out of <hi>Surius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 70.</note> particularly of <hi>Carolus Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeus, Franciſcus Borgia, Antonine</hi> of <hi>Florence, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardinus de Senis.

No other reaſonable account can be given why this ſo very material a Circumſtance ſhould perpetually be omitted in deſcribing the deaths of the Antient Chriſtians, and hardly ever omitted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like occaſion by <hi>Roman</hi> Writers; but that as the thing it ſelf is now conſtantly practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo it was utterly unknown to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That from the fifth Age to the ninth, they that wrote the deaths of Holy Perſons, do very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember that they received the Euchariſt, never that they received Extreme Unction, before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this Life; which is proved by an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Inſtances, out of <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Surius,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Cap. 3. p. 73, 74. &amp;c.</note> But had Extreme Unction been uſed in thoſe times, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given why the mention of that ſhould be perpetually omitted, there being no manner of reaſon why it ſhould not have been as frequently remembred as the other.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That to the ninth Age none of the Antients mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any Queſtion concerning <hi>Penitents</hi> receiving or not receiving Extreme Unction before the Article of Death; whereas nothing had been more proper, if they had believed it to be the <hi>Sacrament of the Dying.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 4. p. 75. &amp;c.</note> For there was a diverſity of Diſcipline as to the communicating of <hi>Penitents</hi> in the Fourth and Fifth ages, and ſo on, from that which obtained in the three Firſt; and it conſiſted in this, that the Firſt were more rigid, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60864:55"/>denied the Euchariſt to thoſe in their departure out of this life, to whom the latter Ages allowed it. But if Extreme Unction had been then uſed, this diverſity had appeared in that, and not in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall produce no more of his Arguments to this purpoſe, theſe being abundantly ſufficient to ſatisfie any diſintereſted Man, that either there was no ſuch thing as Extreme Unction known in the Church for many Ages from the beginning, or elſe the Antients, and indeed all Chriſtian Writers that had any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to treat of the forementioned things, for above a thouſand years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were guilty of unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table folly, and ſtupidity in one and the ſame thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> in omitting not only what was neceſſary for their purpoſe, but moreover plain and eaſie, and, one would think, unavoidable by men of common diligence and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>That one conſideration, which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> objected againſt Extreme Unction, that there are no antient examples of Holy Men anointed in their Extremes, is of it ſelf ſufficient to carry the cauſe from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in point of Antiquity, after once it is made evident that there is no paſſage in any Antient Father that bears witneſs to that pretended Sacrament. Unleſs <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s anſwer may paſs, that there are no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, becauſe
<note n="(t)" place="margin">Cap. VI. §. <hi>Reſpondeo non exſtare, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>things that are generally known, and daily practiſed, do not uſe to be written.</hi> But if this will do, 'tis impoſſible theſe men ſhould ever be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For when we charge them with Innovation in any matters of Doctrine and Practice, if they can ſhew that thoſe things are <hi>Written</hi> in the Antients, we are certainly gone that way; for this proves that to have been well known, and commonly practiſed in the primitive times, which we pretend was but of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60864:55"/>yeſterday. But if we can ſhew that they were <hi>not written,</hi> we get nothing by it at all, for it ſeems the reaſon why they were <hi>not written</hi> is becauſe they were <hi>generally known</hi> and <hi>daily practiſed.</hi> If indeed there had been as pregnant teſtimonies to the uſe of Extreme Unction, as there are, for inſtance, to the anointing of the Baptized with <hi>Chriſm,</hi> one might have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that there ſhould be no mention of any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Antient Church anointed in his extremes; but he could not from thence reaſonably conclude that there was no ſuch Unction, becauſe there is other kind of written teſtimony for it. But the <hi>Chriſm</hi> after Baptiſm, though of leſs moment than Extreme Unction, is plentifully atteſted, as I have ſhewn §. 1. but Extreme Unction not at all; and therefore to anſwer the Objection from want of any one example of this kind in Antiquity, by ſaying, That thoſe things were not written, becauſe they were <hi>perfectly known,</hi> is not to reaſon with an Adverſary, but to face him down.</p>
                  <p>Nor does he mend the matter by ſuppoſing that <hi>Bernard</hi> would not have omitted this Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not written in his Life that he received it. For it appears by other teſtimonies of that Age, that Extreme Unction then began to be in uſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do not deny that S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was anointed in his Extremes, becauſe <hi>Malachias</hi> ſaid nothing of it. But that the lives of ſo many antient Chriſtians ſhould be written, and the manner of their dying pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually deſcribed, and not one of them ſaid to be anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this, we think, makes it very reaſonable to conclude that Extreme Unction had no being in thoſe days, and impoſſible for a reaſonable man to deny it, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no occaſion whatſoever there is any mention of it,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60864:56"/>even where there was all imaginable reaſon to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, excepting this only, that there was no ſuch thing to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>If to ſave the Cardinals ſincerity, it be ſaid, that he had before proved the Doctrine of Extreme Unction by other teſtimonies of Antiquity; I grant that he had done his beſt towards it, but whether to his own ſatisfaction or not, whether to warrant his putting off the want of ſo much as one example, by pretending that <hi>known things are not written,</hi> I ſhall leave the Reader to judge, upon this obſervation: When he had produced and amplified the teſtimony of <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> he concludes thus.

                     <hi>From this Teſtimony we gather why there are not many teſtimonies of this kind,</hi> i.e. <hi>ſo antient and ſo expreſs,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe they had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of writing about this matter. For neither had</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius <hi>written upon it, if the Biſhop of</hi> Eugubium <hi>had not doubted whether a Biſhop might give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> Now let us lay theſe things together. When he excuſes himſelf from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Examples; he tells us, <hi>that things perfectly known and daily practiſed are not wont to be written.</hi> Well! admitting this for the preſent, how ſhall we come to know that Extreme Unction was a thing perfectly known to Antiquity, and daily practiſed? Without all doubt by clear and unqueſtionable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monys of another ſort, and ſuch as will more than bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the want of Examples. And therefore it is to be hoped, that we ſhall not be put off with excuſes when thoſe teſtimonies are deſired. But alas! he begs our pardon here too; for <hi>as things perfectly known are not written,</hi> ſo likewiſe, <hi>we have not many teſtimonies, ſo antient and ſo expreſs, becauſe there was no occaſion for them.</hi> So that there are no antient examples of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60864:56"/>Unction written, becauſe it was <hi>perfectly known;</hi> nor many Teſtimonies for it ſo ancient and ſo expreſs, for <hi>want of occaſion.</hi> Did ever Man talk in this faſhion, that thought his Cauſe was honeſt? And now at laſt the Teſtimony of <hi>Innocentius</hi> had need be a thundring Teſtimony, becauſe we have <hi>not many ſo ancient and ſo expreſs.</hi> And yet neither is his Teſtimony <hi>ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> being no older than the Fifth Age; nor is it <hi>ſo expreſs,</hi> unleſs becauſe 'tis <hi>expreſly</hi> againſt <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> as I have manifeſtly ſhewn the Reaſon of that Teſtimony to be, though <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> be not named there.</p>
                  <p>After all, 'tis notoriouſly falſe, that <hi>things perfectly known and daily uſed, are not written,</hi> which is evident from this very inſtance, that ſince <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> came in faſhion, they ſeldom or never deſcribe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Peoples dying, but they obſerve how they departed with this their Sacrament;
<note n="†" place="margin">Ubi ſupra, p. 70, &amp;c.</note> of which Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> has given great plenty of inſtances.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſſes are ſo clear and full, that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating them, I ſhall take leave to conclude, that they have not only no Tradition for their pretended Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> but that the Tradition of the Ancients is as plainly againſt it, as Tradition can be againſt an Innovation; &amp; he muſt be a very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man that deſires better evidence of this kind for a <hi>Negative.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>AND now it is eaſie from what hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy produced in this Controverſie, to gather how and when this Myſtery of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> gained footing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion. For it already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there are three Unctions of the Sick to be diſtinguiſhed one from the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Unction of the Sick that were miraculouſly cured, and of them only.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Unction of all ſick Perſons whatſoever, but this in order to Bodily health.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Unction not of all ſick Perſons, but of the deſperately ſick, or the dying, and this to take away the Reliques of ſin, and to fortifie their Souls againſt the Agonies of Death; which is the <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe three kinds of anointing the Sick being duly conſidered, will naturally guide us to the occaſions and degrees by which the laſt came to take place, and to the Age in which it began. For the firſt Unction in proceſs of time grew into the ſecond, and the ſecond at laſt into the third.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is not only an ancient Unction, but was from the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> the anointing of thoſe that were healed by a Supernatural Gift. Which Gift continued in the Church more or leſs for ſix Ages after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and was not quite worn out in the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> if we believe our Country-man <hi>Bede</hi> [§. 1.] about which time it was that the ſecond Unction of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60864:57"/>all ſick Perſons whatſoever took place. The chief inducement, to which, ſeemed to be the obſervation of thoſe Cures by anointing, that were wrought by ſuch as had the Gift of Healing; and the reports of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures that were done alſo by the Sacraments of
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Aug. de Civ. D. lib. 22. c. 8.</note> Baptiſm, and
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Naz. Orat. 11. p. 187.</note> the Euchariſt, and
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Theod. Hiſt. c. 21.</note> by Water bleſſed out of Baptiſm, and by the
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Chryſ. in Matth. Hom. 33.</note> Oyl of the Church-Lamps, contributed not a little to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the cuſtom of anointing all ſick Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently. We have already obſerved ſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it in the Fifth Age, in the Epiſtle of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius,</hi> by which it appears, that one of <hi>Decentius</hi> his Queſtions was this, Whether <hi>Chriſm,</hi> or the holy Oyl, that was reſerved in Churches might be applied to the Faithful in their ſickneſs; which <hi>Innocentius</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> And no wonder that in an Age or two more, the cuſtom of anointing all ſick Perſons in order to their recovery was grown general, ſince very ſmall inducements are ſufficient to diſpoſe Men to ſeek for Temporal and Bodily relief, from things that are conſecrated to the uſes of Religion, eſpecially when there are ſome notable examples of ſucceſs. For as yet miraculous Healing by Oyl was not quite ceaſed; and by conſecrated Oyl other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things were ſaid to be done beſides Healing the ſick; ſuch for inſtance as
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Hiſt. Angl. lib. III. cap. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Bede</hi> relates concerning the Voyage of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tta,</hi> a Presbyter, who came to <hi>Aidan</hi> and deſired his Prayers for a proſperous paſſage and return: <hi>Aidan</hi> gave him holy Oyl, telling him that he knew a Tempeſt would overtake him, and charged him that when it began he ſhould throw that into the Sea, for then all would be quiet again, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For ſuch reaſons as theſe, Chriſtians in their diſtreſs were diſpoſed to ſeek for relief and recovery,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60864:58"/>rather by holy Oyl than by any other ſacred matter, eſpecially ſince the Text of S. <hi>James</hi> lay before them, and could be eaſily applied to this practice. So far at leaſt as to create ſome good hope of benefit. To all which we muſt add, That the great appearance of Piety that that practice made, being an expreſſion of repoſing greater confidence in God, than in the force of natural Remedies, made it paſs without oppoſition. And ſo entred,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſacred Unction of the Sick into the Church, not now of thoſe only, who were cured by the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> but of all ſick Perſons whatſoever, in hope of receiving bodily relief by it. Which beginning at the Seventh Age, went on through the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Ages, to the beginning of the Twelfth. 'Tis of this Unction that the <hi>Liber Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum,</hi> ſaid to be Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, gives a full account in the Office of Viſiting the Sick, where 'tis very plain that the Prayers upon that occaſion ſhew the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of Unction to be the recovery of the
<note n="(f)" place="margin">See <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, p. 45, &amp;c.</note> ſick Perſons health. I confeſs, if that Book, as it is now publiſhed, were all of it uſed in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> I. his time, it would be an argument, that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſt, this practice of anointing all the Sick, had obtained in the Sixth Age; and perhaps <hi>Decentius</hi> his Letter to <hi>Innocentius</hi> I. had given a ſtart to it there, ſooner than it had in any other of the great Churches. But whether this Office for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Sick was compoſed at the latter end of the Sixth Age, or afterwards; this one thing I am ſure of, that the Unction there referred to, was altogether accommodated, as by the Prayers it manifeſtly appears, to the raiſing up of the ſick Perſon, and the recovery of his health. Of this Unction it is that <hi>Bede, Alcuinus,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60864:58"/>Amalarius,</hi> the Synods of <hi>Challon, Aken,</hi> and <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Peter Damiani</hi> himſelf ſpake, as any one may ſee by what has been ſaid. Now this Unction was antient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but yet a great way off from the beginning. It agreed with the Primitive Unction in this, that the profeſſed and direct deſign of it, was the recovery of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health; but in this it differ'd from it, that now all ſick perſons were anointed; whereas at firſt thoſe only were ſo for whom the ſupernatural Giſt was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They anointed before for bodily health, and did not fail of the end, becauſe they anointed as they were guided by a ſupernatural impulſe. But now they anointed for the ſame end, but muſt neceſſarily fail very often, becauſe they anointed in courſe and it was grown a ſettled Office in the Church. For which reaſon it is ſomething to be wondred at, that this kind of Unction ſhould laſt ſo long as it did in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and yet more, that it ſhould continue in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to this very day, of which more in its place. For it muſt needs ſeem no little diſparagement to the Ceremony and to the Office belonging to it, that ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruit of it ſhould appear, and that the experience of one Age after another plainly ſhew'd that the virtue and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that uſed to accompany it in the Primitive Church was now to be ſeen no more. But I believe the caſual cures which had happened without any Unction at all were conſtantly made uſe of to ſupport the Reputation of this Rite; to which not only the influence which the Prieſts had upon the People, and that reigning Opinion of thoſe Ages, that nothing guarded Religion more than the Amuſement of many Myſteries; but likewiſe the Zeal of pious and devout Chriſtians contributed very great aſſiſtance: Thus I ſay, this Practice might come to be ſupported ſo long together, that is to ſay, by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy on the one ſide, and credulity on the other; and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60864:59"/>no great harm was there in all this, till at laſt it brought forth <hi>Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in theſe parts of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> For the ſame Policy that had kept up the Rite of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the ſick, upon the foundation of believing that it was good for their bodies, would, when that could hold no longer, lay another, <hi>viz.</hi> That at leaſt it was very good for their Souls; and that when it did not recover the Health of the Sick, yet at leaſt it had a wonderful Virtue to ſave the Soul of the Dying; which pretence had ſome advantages to keep up the Ceremony of Anointing the Sick, that the former had not, and all that it had. Here was enough to entertain the Zeal of well meaning People, and which was ſomething more, here was new comfort too, for the ſlothful and licentious. And in an Age ſo ignorant and barbarons as the Eleventh and Twelfth Ages were, it was eaſy to make this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion go down: And though Unction did not ſave the Soul, yet if the Prieſt ſaid it did, he was not ſo liable to be confuted, as when they ſaid it was good for reſtoring Health, tho' the Patient died of his Diſeaſe preſently after.</p>
                  <p>But another thing which made the entrance of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction more eaſy and unſuſpected, was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time, and the notable preparations that made way for it to come in gradually and inſenſibly, and without the noiſe that violent and ſudden altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make. By the forms of Unction that obtained in the Tenth Age, it appears that they applied it to the Eyes, the Ears, the Noſtrils, the Lips, the Breaſt, and this with reference to the ſins that had been committed by ſeeing, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Menardi Notae in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. Greg. pag. 337.</note> Thus in <hi>Ratoldus</hi> his Form. <hi>I anoint thy Eyes with ſanctified Oyl, that whatever ſin thou haſt committed by unlawful ſeeing, may be expiated by the anointing of this Oyl;</hi> the intention of which kind
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60864:59"/>of forms is ſufficiently explained by that which follows,
<note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. p. 338.</note> 
                     <hi>I anoint thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that by the Operation of this Myſtery, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction of this Holy Oyl, and our prayer, thou being relieved and cheriſhed mayeſt through the power of the Holy Spirit be ſo happy as to obtain thy former and better Health.</hi> By which it is highly reaſonable to ſay, that the anointing the Senſes, and the ſeveral remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of the Body with reference to the ſins of the ſick perſon, did it ſelf refer to the recovery of his Health; and that the ſickneſs being ſuppoſed to be ſent for the puniſhment of ſome ſin or other, they made ſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precare all they could think of, that the ſin being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, the ſickneſs might be removed. This Form, as
<note n="*" place="margin">Praef<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardi in Sac. Gr.</note> 
                     <hi>Menardus</hi> ſhews, was written in the Tenth Age, as that which was taken out of <hi>Tilius</hi> his Library was in the Eleventh, and that of the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Remigius</hi> between the Tenth and Eleventh.
<note n="†" place="margin">Men. Notae. p. 140. 334, &amp;c.</note> They are all of the ſame ſtrain; and that which I note from them is this, That the plentiful care that is taken in them, for the deprecation of the Guilt of all kind of ſins, made the whole Ceremony look ſomething like anointing for the cleanſing of the Soul, rather than the recovering of the Body, though this was the direct intention of the whole; and ſo it was not not ſo dangerous a leap in the next Age to forget, or at leaſt to take very little notice of the bodily effect which was deſign'd by Unction, and to turn the whole Myſtery into a proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good of the Soul; eſpecially, ſince there were many more words uſed to expreſs the deprecation of Guilt, then in the Prayer for recovery of Health, tho' the former was in order to the later. To this I add alſo, that in all likelihood this ſolemn, particular and circumſtantial Unction of the ſeveral parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and deprecation of the Guilt contracted by them, was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60864:60"/>it ſelf by degrees brought in, to ſave the credit of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, under which the Sick died or recovered; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as certainly as they would have done without it. For that care that was taken to anoint them ſo formally for thoſe ſins which were preſumed to have brought that ſickneſs, made the whole buſineſs look as if it were good for the Soul at leaſt, whatever became of the Body. And thus,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. About the Twelfth Age came <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, for we can hear no tidings of it from any of the former. And it is therefore no <hi>Primitive</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as the <hi>Firſt.</hi> Unction of the Sick was, nor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> practice, as the Second was; but an Innovation that crept in when the middle Ages of the Church were now advancing apace to the laſt. It was begotten in that thick Night of Ignorance and Barbariſm, that ſhuffled this and ſome other Children of Darkneſs into the Weſtern Church. It was licked into ſome ſhape, and brought to a Form of Doctrine by the Schoolmen; and being almoſt grown to what it now is, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly owned by <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. at the cloſe of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Synod, in the year 1438. to be the <hi>Fifth</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and in the next Age came to be eſtabliſhed under <hi>Anathemas</hi> by the Fathers of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if we compare theſe <hi>Three</hi> ſeveral <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctions of the Sick,</hi> one with another, the Differences will appear to be theſe:</p>
                  <p>The Antient Unction did indeed agree with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive one in this, that both were applied for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of bodily Health: But then in this they differed, as we obſerved before, that the Primitive Unction was applied but to ſome ſick perſons, and that by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and impulſe of the Holy Spirit; but the Ancient Unction was applied to all the ſick, and grew to be a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60864:60"/>ſettled Office in the Church; and therefore there was this difference alſo, that by the Primitive Unction all were reſtor'd to Health who were anointed; not ſo by the Antient one; and if a man may freely ſpeak his mind, it had juſt ſuch a ſupernatural effect upon the Bodies of the Sick, as the New Unction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has upon the Souls of the Dying, that is, none at all.</p>
                  <p>This new Unction, which they call <hi>Extreme,</hi> is vaſtly different from the <hi>Antient</hi> one in many points, ſome of which I ſhall briefly repreſent in that Order wherein
<note n="‖" place="margin">Ubi ſupra. Cap. 18.</note> Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> has more largely conſidered them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The end of the Ancient Unction was the recovery of bodily Health; but the end of <hi>Extreme</hi> Unction is to prepare the Soul for its paſſage into the other life. This was one of the antient Forms of Unction.
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Vide Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardi Not. in Sacram. Greg. p 341. Vide etiam Vetuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las in Caſſandr. Schol. in Hymn. Eccl. p. 288.</note> 
                     <hi>I anoint thee with Holy Oyl in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; that by the Operation of this Myſtery, being cheriſhed, thou maiest be ſo happy as to obtain thy former and better Health.</hi> But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church this is all, <hi>By this Holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, and by his moſt Holy Mercy, God forgive thee whatſoever ſin thou haſt committed, by Seeing, Hearing, Taſting, Smelling, and Touching.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a great difference alſo, touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons anointed, which according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction, are thoſe only who are <hi>baptized,</hi> and amongſt theſe none but the <hi>ſick,</hi> and of theſe only <hi>the adult,</hi> and ſuch as are in all appearance <hi>dying</hi> perſons. But it was quite otherwiſe in the antient Church. For they anointed thoſe that were
<note n="(g)" place="margin">Innoc. III. ubi ſupra.</note> 
                     <hi>preparing for Baptiſm;</hi> they anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe that were
<note n="(h)" place="margin">Beda in Jac. v.</note> 
                     <hi>poſſeſſed;</hi> they anointed
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Caſſand. Schol. in Hymn. Eccl. p. 289.</note> 
                     <hi>Infants,</hi> and, which is the moſt remarkable difference of all, they anointed not dying perſons, but the ſick of whoſe recovery they had reaſonable hopes; as we have proved
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60864:61"/>before. The antient Unction in all theſe reſpects being ſuitable to the end of it, which was bodily Health, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction is in every one of them accommodated to its pretence of being a Sacrament for the forgiving of ſins, and the ſaving of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Accordingly the
<note n="(k)" place="margin">Caſſand ubi ſupra. p. 288.</note> anient Unction was applied to thoſe parts of the Body, as near as they could, which were the ſeat of the diſeaſe; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction pretending to purifie the Soul, is applied to the Five Senſes, to the Feet and the Reins, as to the ſeats of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Antients
<note n="*" place="margin">Menard. ubi ſupra.</note> anointed for ſeven days together, plainly thereby intimating the hope they had of doing good upon the Patient, by repetition of the Remedy. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> anoint but once in a diſeaſe, and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Antients firſt anointed, then gave the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; firſt they tried the Remedy for the Body, then they gave the <hi>Viaticum</hi> for the ſoul. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> make their Unction the laſt of all the Sacraments, doing thereby agreeably to their practice, which is to anoint for the cleanſing of the ſoul, when there is now little or no hope of the Body.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, The Unction of the Ancients might be adminiſtred by Lay-perſons; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrament muſt not be applied by any but by a Presbyter at leaſt. To which I add, that</p>
                  <p>It agrees with the antient Unction in that point only, wherein the antient differs from the Primitive, <hi>i. e.</hi> that whereas the <hi>Primitive</hi> Unction was directed by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; on the other hand, as the <hi>antient</hi> Unction was under a ſetled Office for the anointing of all the Sick, ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction is reduced alſo to a ſetled Office for the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all (with ſuch reſtrictions as we obſerved before) that are deſperately Sick, or dying.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:60864:61"/>
                  <p>And thus the Antient Unction agrees with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, as a mixed colour does with white; but there is no more likeneſs between the <hi>Primitive</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction, than there is between white and black. Thus much for the Occaſions, the Time, and the Nature of that Change which has been made in this matter of the Unction of the Sick.</p>

                     <hi>Arcudius</hi> himſelf: <hi>Here another opinion of the Innovating</hi> Latins <hi>is overthrown; for theſe men ſay, that the holy Oyl ought not to be given to thoſe that have hope of life, but to thoſe that are dying, becauſe it confers remiſſion of ſins; judging and practiſing quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Apoſtle ſays, as in all other things, ſo alſo in this. For whereas the Brother of our Lord cries out,</hi> And the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; <hi>theſe men ſay it is to be given to thoſe who are not raiſed up.</hi> And again, <hi>The</hi> Latins <hi>who Innovate in all things, have corrupted this Rite alſo, and ſay it is not to be applied to the Sick, but to the Dying.

<note n="(u)" place="margin">Ibid. p. 417.</note> 
                     <hi>the Priest takes the holy Oil and anoints him that is to receive the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, and is to be prayed for, ſaying the following Prayer: Holy Father, the Phyſician of Souls and Bodies,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60864:63"/>who didſt ſend thy only begotten Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, healing every diſeaſe, and redeeming us from death, heal this thy ſervant of his bodily and ſpiritual diſeaſe which has laid hold upon him, and revive him through the Grace of thine Anointed, by the Interceſſions of our Holy Lady, the Mother of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By the Protection of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Incorporeal Powers, by the virtue of the precious and life-giving Croſs—of</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt—<hi>the Apoſtles, the Martyrs—and our Godlike Fathers, the Holy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians that received no Fees,</hi> Coſmas <hi>and</hi> Damian, Cyrus <hi>and</hi> John, Pantaleon <hi>and</hi> Hermolaus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Prayer indeed here is a great deal of wretched ſtuff of another kind; but not a word that looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> the whole relating to the intention of the Antient Unction, which was to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sick; and therefore the Prieſt pleads in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the Interceſſion of thoſe Saints that were ſaid to have been particularly famous for the cure of Diſeaſes. And that which is remarkable in the caſe, is this, that the Rubrick requires every one of the other ſix Prieſts, when he anoints the Sick, to uſe this very Prayer; which plainly ſhews that every one of them anoints for the ſame end and purpoſe. Neither is it any advantage towards the <hi>Roman</hi> pretence, that the Prieſt prays alſo for the cure of the ſpiritual infirmity which holds the ſick perſon; it being evident, as <hi>Simeon Theſſalonicenſis</hi> obſerves, that the diſeaſe of the body being inflicted for the ſin of the ſoul, the cauſe is to be removed, that the effect may ceaſe. Nor indeed is it fit that we ſhould pray for any bleſſing of this life, without imploring Gods pardon of thoſe ſins which make us unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p>At length the ſecond Prieſt prays,
<note n="(w)" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 418.</note> 
                     <hi>O God great and high, who art adored by every creature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60864:63"/>and hearken unto us thy unworthy ſervants, and when in thy name we bring forth this Oyl, do thou ſend forth the medicines of thy free gift, and the pardon of ſins, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of thy mercies heal theſe perſons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then the Third Prieſt to the ſame purpoſe.
<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. p 420.</note> 
                     <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord, Holy King, who doſt chaſtiſe and not deliver to death, who ſupporteſt thoſe that fall, and ſettest ſtraight thoſe that are broken, and repaireſt the bodily infirmities of men, we beſeech thee, O our God, to ſend forth thy Mercy upon this Oyl, and upon thoſe that are anointed with it in thy Name, that it may become to them the healing both of Soul and Body, their deliverance from all grief, and every diſeaſe and malady; and laſtly, from all defilement of Fleſh and Spirit. So Lord, ſend thou from Heaven thy healing Virtue: Do thou touch the Body, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Fever, mitigate the pain, and expel every hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Infirmity. Be thou the Phyſitian of this thy Servant; raiſe him up from the Bed of grief, and the Couch of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Be pleaſed to reſtore him ſafe and every way healthy to thy Church, to pleaſe thee, and to do thy will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the ſame nature are the Prayers of the following Prieſts; this being repeated after every Goſpel in each adminiſtration, <hi>We ſtill pray for Mercy, Life, Peace, Health, and Deliverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add the beginning of the Prayer offer'd by the Fourth Prieſt; becauſe it ſhews how that Church underſtands the place of St. <hi>James</hi> ſo often mentioned.
<note n="(x)" place="margin">Ib. p. 421.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord who art Good, and the lover of Mankind, the God of tender Compaſſion and great Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who by thy Holy Apoſtles haſt given us Authority to undertake the cure of the Infirmities of thy People, do thou alſo cauſe this Oyl to be a means of Healing all thoſe that are to be anointed with it, to be a remedy againſt every diſeaſe, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60864:64"/>every malady, and a deliverance from evils to thoſe that expect Health from thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For by this it appears that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients did, underſtand St. <hi>James</hi>'s Unction to be the ſame with that of the Apoſtles in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and conſequently refer it to bodily cures: And that they ground their Authority to anoint the ſick in order to bodily Health, upon theſe places of Scripture ſo underſtood. And now I ſhall make bold to ſay, That there is nothing in their whole <hi>Office of Holy Oyl,</hi> that does in the leaſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> but take it all together, 'tis in effect a flat contradiction to it. And therefore to make it look a little <hi>Roman</hi> like, the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlator (Father <hi>Goar</hi> by name) has falſified the Rubrick before the Prayer that is to be repeated by every Prieſt, and with very convenient impudence rendered it thus:

                     <hi>And after the Prayer</hi> [of Conſecration] <hi>the Priest taketh the Holy Oyl, and anointeth him that receiveth EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TREME <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NCTION, ſaying the following Prayer.</hi> Whereas he ought to have tranſlated it thus—<hi>and Anointeth him that waiteth there for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction and Prayer:</hi> Not, <hi>that receiveth Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> as the falſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator would have it.

                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, tho' the <hi>Greek</hi> Church hath in ſome things innovated no leſs than the <hi>Roman,</hi> yet in others ſhe has kept to ancient Tradition, where the <hi>Roman</hi> has not; and of this their Unction is one notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is apparently that Unction which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take place in the Seventh Age after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the <hi>Roman</hi> Unction is ſo far from having Primitive Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that 'tis not ſo much as an ancient Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Unction of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is.

                     </note> 
                     <q>Since our Lord inſtituted Sacraments, by which, as by Divine Aids, we ſhould be aſſiſted in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church, and in our Progreſs in it; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is by no means to be believed, that his Divine Providence has been wanting in our going out, and paſſing from this temporal Militant Church, to the other that is Everlaſting; eſpecially, ſince a man is never in greater want of help and defence, than in the Article of Death, as the Fathers teach every where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For then our Adverſaries aſſail us more powerfully, becauſe they ſee their time is ſhort; and man himſelf is never more unfit to make reſiſtance, by reaſon of the greatneſs of his Pains and Sickneſs. For if this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body is a burden to the Soul, even in its beſt eſtate of Health; ſurely, in the very Act of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it will be the heavieſt weight of all; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it ſelf ſhews, that the Sick who are dying

                  </p>
                  <p>He had tried the Scripture before; he had alſo tried Antiquity; and now at laſt he comes with an Argument diſtinct from all Teſtimony, which he calls <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and which is therefore <hi>mere</hi> Reaſon, becauſe 'tis oppoſed to all Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>Now to this Arguing, I have two things to ſay, 1. That to pretend the proof of a Sacrament by meer Reaſon, is it ſelf a moſt unreaſonable thing. 2. That if this way were allowable, yet the Reaſoning inſinuated by the Council, and more diſtinctly explain'd by the Cardinal, is weak and trifling.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That to pretend the proof of a Sacrament by mere Reaſon, is a moſt unreaſonable pretence. For Sacraments cannot otherwiſe be proved, than by Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Divine Revelation, becauſe they depend upon Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The Definition of a Sacrament in the Catechiſm of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is this,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Catech. ad Paroc. part. 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 10.</note> 
                     <hi>A Sacrament is a thing ſubject to the Senſes, which by the INSTIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TION OF GOD, has the power both to ſignifie, and to effect Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</hi> This Definition is
<note n="(c)" place="margin">De Sacram in genere, lib. 1. cap. xi.

<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ibid. &amp; cap. ix. Sect. <hi>Tertium eſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ut hoc,</hi> &amp;c.</note> One of thoſe Points was this, that a Sacrament is a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> or <hi>given</hi> Sign, depending upon <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> And this he affirmed to be a Point which <hi>no one Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts,</hi> and that <hi>the thing loudly ſpeaks it ſelf.</hi> Now I would know how 'tis poſſible to prove by meer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that God has inſtituted any thing, which to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, or not to inſtitute, depended upon his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Thoſe things indeed, which to do, or not to do, is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, we may know
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60864:66"/>by mere natural Reaſon: But that ſuch Reaſon can find out thoſe <hi>things of God,</hi> which depended upon his Will and Pleaſure, or that Reaſon ſhould be able to prove them otherwiſe than by Teſtimonies of Revelation, is a diſcovery that I believe was never heard of before. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I am ſure, was quite of another mind.
<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Cor. ii. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>For</hi> ſays he, <hi>what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man, which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Which Maxim the Apoſtle uſed in a Diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, and therefore could not be thought to ſupport the credit of it by his Authority, but to lay it down as a point Point evident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reaſon. Since, therefore Sacraments properly ſo called, do by the Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtand upon Inſtitution, and did depend upon the free Will and Pleaſure of God; the very pretence to prove <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> to be a Sacrament by Reaſon, abſtracted from Divine Teſtimonies, muſt needs be abſurd; if abſurd it be, to go about a thing that is impoſſible to be done, even by that mans Principles who pretends to do it; eſpecially, if thoſe Principles are ſo clear and evident, that <hi>no one Perſon contradicts them.</hi>

For to conclude, that in matters depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Pleaſure of God, he hath done that which ſeemeth beſt to our Reaſon; is to ſuppoſe that in theſe things we know what is beſt, no leſs than God doth; that we have weighed all the Conveniences and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of either ſide, the Advantages and Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of every thing that lies before us; the Arguments for, and the Objections againſt this or that, with the ſame exactneſs, wherein they are comprehended in his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60864:66"/>infinite Underſtanding. The Cardinal might as well have ſaid in plain terms, God ought to have inſtituted the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> and therefore he has done it. For he tells us,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Certe nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo modo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum eſt defuiſſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ejus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>it is by no means to be believed that his Divine Providence has been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our going out of this Militant Church,</hi> &amp;c. If, therefore God has not inſtituted the Sacrament of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> to convey us ſafely out of this World; <hi>it is to be believed,</hi> that he hath <hi>been wanting</hi> to his Church; but it is not to be believed that he hath been wanting, becauſe he ought not ſo to be, and therefore he hath inſtituted that Sacrament. Which arguing has not the leaſt appearance of <hi>Senſe,</hi> without the help of another Propoſition, which gives it more than the appearance of Blaſphemy, That <hi>it is by no means to be believed,</hi> that God is wiſer than a Cardinal, or a Council.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, when once the Inſtitutions of God are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and teſtified to us, we muſt not only conclude, that they are Wiſe and Good, becauſe they are his, but we ought alſo to take notice of thoſe footſteps of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which are diſcernable in them. And the more that a wiſe man conſiders and underſtands their ends and uſefulneſs, the more worthy of their Author he will find them to be. But their congruity to our Reaſon is not the proof of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, ſince there are very many things, which to our finite Underſtandings would appear as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and as reaſonable, but which yet God hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. And therefore, unleſs we knew all thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of things to one another, which God only knows, when we conſider the Myſteries of Religion; we ought to conclude that he hath appointed what is beſt for us, not ſo much, becauſe of that Wiſdom and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60864:67"/>Goodneſs which we diſcern in his Inſtitutions, though we are able to diſcover a great deal, as becauſe theſe Inſtitutions are his.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure that our Lord inſtituted two Sacraments for his Church, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> I ſee clearly, that as they were accommodated to ſome Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, to which the Goſpel was firſt to be Preached, ſo in all reſpects that I can think of, they are wiſely contrived for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the Gentiles too: that they ſignifie the moſt important duties and motives of the Goſpel, and that their ſignification is eaſie and obvious; that they repreſent the greateſt Grace of God towards ſinners in this life, and this by very lively and inſtructing ſigns; that they are framed to quicken a reaſonable ſervice of God, to excite a wiſe devotion in the people, and to command humble reverence from all; that there is nothing wanting in them to admoniſh us of our great obligations, and to give comfort where comfort is due, by being pledges to us of that Grace which they ſignifie, if we apply our ſelves to that Duty which they ſignifie too: Laſtly, that they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to our imperfect ſtate, who are clothed with this fleſh and blood, and ſeem to need therefore ſome ſenſible and ſolemn Myſteries to aſſiſt that vital and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part of Religion, which begins in the ſoul, and runs through the life; But yet that they are not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as to amuſe a Chriſtian with an outward pomp, or to be an occaſion of diverting him from the inward worſhip of God, or of abating the ſenſe of that pure and undefiled Religion before God, which conſiſts in a life of charity and purity.</p>
                  <p>There are very many advantages and conveniences which I diſcern in theſe two Sacraments, now that they are eſtabliſhed by the Authority of our Lord Jeſus.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60864:67"/>But if there had not been good proof of their Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I truſt in God that all the Reaſons of convenience which the wit of man could have brought together, ſhould never have carried me to this ſaucy concluſion, <hi>Therefore God hath appointed theſe two Rites to be Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Church, for the ſignifying and conveying of his Grace to ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even where the appointments of God are evident, that wiſdom and goodneſs which I can diſcover in them, is not the proper ground of my aſſurance that he hath eſtabliſhed them, for that is no other than <hi>the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Inſtitution.</hi> Nor can that diſcovery alone give me the leaſt aſſurance that in making ſuch proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath not been wanting to our needs; for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that aſſurance is this, that it is <hi>He,</hi> it is <hi>God,</hi> I ſay, <hi>that hath made ſuch proviſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When it once appears what God hath inſtituted in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Salvation, and no more, we are to conclude that this is enough in its kind, becauſe 'tis all that God hath done. But for that other kind of arguing, that God has been wanting to us in his Inſtitutions, if he has not inſtituted <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and therefore he has inſtituted it; I leave it to thoſe whoſe concluſions need it; very much deſiring them to conſider what a cauſe that muſt be, which drives them to ſuch bold reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe are.
<note n="(g)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note> For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may inſtruct him? But we have the mind of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>That the Reaſon brought to prove that Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction was fit to be inſtituted, has not ſo much as any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUT ſecondly, <hi>If it were an allowable way to conclude a Divine Inſtitution from what appears to us fit to have been Inſtituted, yet the reaſon of this kind uſed by</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>in behalf of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, has not ſo much as the face of probability.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was rather a juſt indignation, than the need of uſing many words to make the thing plain, that held me ſo long in the former Anſwer: And it is ſuch another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that I muſt make for inſiſting at all upon this. For if it be in it ſelf abſurd and a diſhonourable reflection upon Almighty God to pretend to prove Sacraments by meer natural reaſonings; then how plauſible ſoever thoſe reaſonings may ſeem to be, they deſerve no other anſwer than ſilence and contempt. But there is this temptation to ſay ſomething to 'em, if it be but to ſhew, that when men will go about to make themſelves, as theſe men in effect have done, as wiſe as God, they are ſo far from <hi>ſpeaking wiſdom,</hi> that they do but betray their own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weakneſs. I ſhall therefore ſhew theſe two things: 1. That the Cardinals reaſoning for the Inſtitution of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> from the congruity of the thing, is mean and trifling. 2. That if this point were to go by ſuch arguing, there are much more plauſible things to be ſaid againſt it, than he has produced for it.</p>
                  <p>His reaſon from the congruity of the thing, in ſhort, is this, That becauſe we have one Sacrament to aſſiſt us in our <hi>entrance</hi> into the Church, and ſome others in our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:60864:68"/>in it, therefore 'tis not to be believed that God ſhould be ſo wanting to us, as not to add yet another to aſſiſt us in <hi>going out</hi> of this Militant Church, becauſe then we have the greateſt need of a Sacrament. But this reaſoning is liable to many troubleſome Objections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas a Reaſon to prove that God hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a certain Sacrament, becauſe otherwiſe he had been wanting to us in our need; when as ſuch a Reaſon, I ſay ought to be of the plaineſt and moſt convincing kind; this is very far from it; being founded upon a meer Analogy, and that a congruity rather of words than things. There is one Sacrament to let us in, and others to carry us on, and therefore there muſt be yet another to bring us off. This is what the Cardinal calls Reaſon, but in truth it looks more like the wantonneſs of a Fancy that cannot be quiet without two ſets of Things to make a handſome Figure one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that as there is <hi>Entring in,</hi> and <hi>Going on,</hi> and <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out</hi> on the one ſide, ſo there may be a Figure of three Kinds of Sacraments to anſwer thoſe three ſtates on the other. If it be ſaid, that the force of the Argument lies in the great danger we are in when death is at hand; I anſwer, That does by no means imply the need of a proper Sacrament to aſſiſt in that danger. For if God pleaſes, he can then give ſufficient aſſiſtance without any Sacrament at all; or if he intended to aſſiſt by a Sacrament, there is I am ſure nothing in the nature of the thing to hinder, but that he may aſſiſt by the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt at the hour of death, though it be not a Sacrament proper to the Dying. And if this be true, there is nothing in the Argument, why God muſt needs have appointed <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> for the Dying; but that the Number <hi>Three</hi> ought go round, for the pleaſing of their Imaginations, who are entertained to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60864:69"/>their liking more with regular Figures and Analogies, than with ſubſtantial and uſeful Truth.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I am not very much concerned to ſee men take theſe pretty congruities, and make them reaſons for what they do themſelves, provided they will reſt there, and not make them Rules for what God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does. When
<note n="(h)" place="margin">Arcud ubi ſupra. cap. 3</note> 
                     <hi>Simeon Theſſalonicenſis</hi> tells us why in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church there are Seven Prieſts to anoint the Sick, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of all the <hi>Sevens</hi> that he could readily think of, I am very well content; for it being indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, whether there were Seven Prieſts or not, an indifferent reaſon, I thought, would ſerve the turn one way or other. But it is not to be endured to put theſe petty Arguings upon the Infinite Wiſdom of God, by obliging him to appoint Sacraments for the ſake of fanciful and neat Analogies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To make this Analogy hold, the Cardinal did not think fit to mention ſome of the Sacraments of his Church, ſome of thoſe I mean that are for the aiding of us in our <hi>progreſs</hi> after <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as they hold; for in this whole Chapter he mentions none of theſe but the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</hi> Now with them there are Seven in all, <hi>i. e.</hi> Five between the firſt and the laſt; from which Five indeed he might well have excepted <hi>Holy Matrimony,</hi> and <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> becauſe according to them, theſe two can never meet to the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of the ſame perſons in their progreſs through the World, and becauſe they are not neceſſary to all. But the Sacraments of <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Penance</hi> being added to the Euchariſt, do certainly make <hi>Three</hi> for our <hi>progreſs</hi> in the Church. Nor can I imagin why thoſe two were not remembred, but for fear of ſpoiling the handſomeneſs of the Analogy, and of raiſing an expectation of more than one Sacrament proper for us in our <hi>Egreſs</hi> out of the Militant Church;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60864:69"/>eſpecially, ſince our dangers are ſaid to be then greater, and our ſtrength to encounter them leſs than in the whole courſe of our life beſides. The truth is, if the Inſtitution of Sacraments muſt be thought to go by ſuch Congruities as theſe, it would be impoſſible for men to agree about the number and the uſe of Sacraments, till they all agree in the ſame Phanſies of Congruity. And yet nothing in the World ſeems to have greater variety, than Phanſy has.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there were ſome colour of Agrument in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Congruity, yet in one that is ſtrain'd and forced, there is none at all. For ſuch is the congruity of being furniſh'd with a Sacrament for our <hi>going out,</hi> as we are with a Sacrament for our <hi>entring into</hi> the Church. If the oppoſition had been natural, either Baptiſm muſt have received us into the life of this World, as <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is intended ſo ſecure our paſſage out of it; or <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> muſt ſend us out of the Church, as Baptiſm does enter us into it. No man will ſay the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the latter; and therefore he was fain to add the conſideration of the Churches <hi>Militancy</hi> in this life, to ſave himſelf from the abſurdity of making <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> the Sacrament of our going out of the Church, as Baptiſm is the Sacrament of our entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But then this ſpoils the congruity of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he that is baptized, does thereby become a Member of that Church, part whereof is in Heaven; but he that is anointed with <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, no not when he dies, ceaſe to be a member of that Church, part whereof is upon Earth, if he dies in the Lord. And therefore it cannot be ſaid that he goes out of the Church by death, as he entred into it by Baptiſm: For by death it ſelf he makes a farther progreſs in it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the effect of Baptiſm is this, That thereby we were actually admitted into the Church: But is it the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60864:70"/>effect of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> to paſs us out of the Militant Church? 'Tis the Sacrament of the Dying, they ſay; but what effect has it, if the ſick perſon happens to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover after anointing? Did his anointing aſſiſt him in his paſſage out of this World, though he tarried in it ſtill? Or is it only a Sacrament that confers the Grace proper to it, and is good for its end, if there be occaſion for it? Or a Sacrament by it ſelf, that, when it happens to do no good, will be ſure to do no harm? It is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to lay any great weight upon theſe ſlender congruities.</p>
                  <p>And therefore diſmiſſing the Analogy of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> to Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, and the congruity of providing a Sacrament for our <hi>Egreſs,</hi> to anſwer the Sacraments of <hi>Ingreſs</hi> and <hi>Progreſs,</hi> we have nothing to conſider, but the ſingle congruity of providing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent aſſiſtance for the Faithful, in ſo dangerous an hour as the hour of death. But to this alſo I have ſpoken already; and ſhall now add,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we do not in the leaſt doubt, but as God is preſent with his faithful Servants in all conditions of life to deliver them out of Temptation, ſo he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them in the hour of death, nor then ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able; but we ſay that this does not infer any the leaſt need, or even congruity that he ſhould therefore inſtitute a Sacrament proper for the comfort and aſſiſtance of the Dying; ſince if he is pleaſed upon our Prayer to give the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit in that caſe without ſuch a Sacrament, our needs in that time of danger are as effectually ſupplied, as if ſuch a Sacrament had been added. And therefore <hi>Chemnitius</hi> did well to ſay, That other guards and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are not to be ſought for the dying, than thoſe that are provided for the living; <hi>viz.</hi> the Word of God, the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60864:70"/>remembrance of Baptiſm, and the reception of the Euchariſt, which are all profitable to the dying. And
<note n="(h)" place="margin">Ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. Cap. V.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmin</hi> did very ill to anſwer, that at this rate there would be no need of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after Baptiſm. For in order to the receiving of Divine Grace, we muſt obſerve Divine Inſtitutions. God was not bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Sacraments for us, and I think no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but if he had pleaſed, he could have ſaved us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; but when he has once inſtituted them, we are bound to obſerve them, if we expect Grace to help us in the time of our need.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it were true that a ſufficient aid could not be provided in the dangerous hour of death, but by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament proper and ſpecial to the caſe, ſuch as <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is ſuppoſed to be; then they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt either ſay that God has been wanting to thoſe dying perſons for whom he has not provided ſuch a Remedy, or elſe that themſelves are horribly to blame in refuſing it to them. For they do not adminiſter <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> but to thoſe that are dying of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for if a man is to die a violent death, or be in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of death any other way than by a diſeaſe; according to their Doctrine and Practice, he is not to be anointed with <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> But if it be the proper guard of the dying, all reaſon in the World requires that it ſhould be adminiſtred to the later, no leſs than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. They that are to to die a violent death, need ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort not leſs, but rather more than thoſe that are dying a <hi>natural</hi> death, as we uſe to call it; and they are every whit as capable of the ſpiritual advantages of the pretended Sacrament, as theſe are; and one would think, ſomething more than many of them. For we are told that
<note n="(i)" place="margin">Bell. all ſupra.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe in paſſing out of this World there are ſpecial difficulties, therefore our Lord has
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60864:71"/>inſtituted a ſpecial help and defence: Chiefly becauſe it often happens that they who are drawing on, can neither hear the word of Exhortation, nor receive the Euchariſt, being oppreſſed by their Diſeaſe, and deprived of the uſe of their Senſes; but they may be anointed and receive the fruit of this Sacrament.</hi> Now what the ſpiritual dangers or difficulties are or can be of thoſe who have thus far ſafely advanced towards their end, as to <hi>be deprived of the uſe of their Senſes,</hi> I am not able to imagin; for it ſeems evident to me, that if through the Grace of God, they have to that moment well acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Devil may from that time be ſuffered to do his worſt upon them, nor can there be any need of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> to guard and fortifie them, who now are out of all danger of their ſpiritual enemies. But thoſe who are yet in their full health, and know they muſt die by violence in a few Minutes, though they are ſubject to the Terrors of Death, and capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving comforts againſt it; though they underſtand their own needs, and can ſubmit to remedies; muſt, it ſeems, be left without this ſpecial guard of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> while they are to be anointed, and to receive the fruit of this Sacrament, who are paſt all apprehenſion of any thing that can be ſaid or done to them, and in all appearance are as incapable of receiving any benefit by it, as if they were ſtark dead. But this I confeſs, that there is a notable congruity between the ſuppoſed need of the dying perſons laſt mentioned by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the ſuppoſed remedy. For <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> will do juſt as much good to the Souls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who are deprived of the uſe of their Senſes, as their Adverſary the Devil can do them harm.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>IF this Point were to go by ſuch arguings, there are more plauſible things to be ſaid againſt it, than thoſe which the Cardinal has produced for it.</hi> What he has offered, we have ſeen already. Now it ſeems to be much more ſubſtantial to argue in this manner againſt this pretended Sacrament for the Dying.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there was nothing like it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, who yet had abundance of Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies inſtituted for them by God himſelf. Now if it had been of ſuch mighty conſequence as is pretended, that dying perſons ſhould be provided with a Sacrament proper to their caſe, it is not to be believed, but that God would have furniſhed that People, of whom he took an eſpecial care, with ſomething of this kind; eſpecially, ſince their Religion had a vaſt number of Inſtitutions. They had Rites inſtituted by God himſelf, which may be ſaid to anſwer our Baptiſm and Euchariſt; but they had none to paſs them ſafely out of this World, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the pretence of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> And yet their dying needs were the ſame with ours, their ſickneſs as painful, and their Temptations as many; nor can any reaſon be aſſigned, why they ſhould not have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a proper Sacrament in the caſe, as well as we. But yet no ſuch Proviſion was made for them. And therefore it ſhould ſeem that no ſuch proviſion was made for us neither. For if they had no need of ſuch a thing, neither ſhould it be thought needful for us.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60864:72"/>
                  <p n="2">2. There is farther to be ſaid from the Reaſon of the thing, That a Sacrament proper for dying perſons would be more liable to be abuſed by placing too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it, than any other Inſtitution whatſoever. For thoſe careleſs and licentious perſons who are apt to rely more than they ought even upon Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, which are manifeſt engagements to a Holy life for the time to come, would much more eaſily perſwade themſelves, that a Sacrament proper to their dying hour, and which could have no reſpect to any duty to be performed by them afterwards, muſt be of no other uſe in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than to take away the guilt and impurity which they had contracted heretofore: Which would be a dangerous temptation and encouragement to live as they liſt, in hope of making all good at laſt by a Repentance, and by a Sacrament proper to a Death-bed. It ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſonable to believe (if People will be ſo bold as to make reaſons for God) that what aſſiſtance God would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford by a Sacrament in the eaſe of a dying man, ſhould be conferred by means of a Sacrament not proper to a Dying man, but one of conſtant uſe in the courſe of his life, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which being alſo a Sacrament no leſs ſignifying our own duty, than the Grace of God, would not ſo eaſily be turned into an occaſion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For becauſe it is a Sacrament that was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be received in the time of Health, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when ſick perſons receive it, they muſt be very ſtupid to think it has any other kind of efficacy at that time, than when they received it in their Health, that is to ſay, than a conditional efficacy, conveying to them the Grace which it ſignifies, upon their being qualified as the Sacrament ſuppoſes them to be. But a Sacrament for the dying, has not its efficacy till a little before death; and therefore ſeems not to have much reſpect

                  <p>But after all, had it pleaſed God to inſtitute <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> or any other Sacrament proper for the dying, I am not that wretch that would have laid the leaſt weight upon theſe reaſonings, againſt the Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor do I now offer them as Arguments to prove that God hath not inſtituted any ſuch thing, (for the true ground upon which we affirm there was no ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is, That there is not the leaſt evidence of the Fact) but only to ſhew that the Cardinal was not leſs unfortunate in his Reaſonings themſelves, why God ought to have inſtituted <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> than preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in offering to prove it, by any ſuch Reaſonings whatſoever: For tho preſumptions of this kind are not to be brought either for or againſt an Inſtitution under queſtion, yet the preſumptions on our ſide are much more reaſonable than thoſe of his.</p>

                  <p>BUT now perhaps it may be asked by one or other, To what good end all this ſerves? Why muſt it be made to appear that Scripture, Reaſon and Antiquity, are all vainly pretended in behalf of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction?</hi> The Opinion and Practiſe of it does not ſtand in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to any Inſtitution of our Saviour, or any expreſs Rule of the Goſpel, and might therefore without great harm be indulged, at leaſt not oppoſed, now it has ſpread
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60864:73"/>as far and wide as the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion goes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince we charge them with ſo many Doctrines and Practices, which as we ſay, do manifeſtly contradict the Scriptures? To inſiſt upon ſmall faults, is to heighten ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and to make our breaches deſperate. And while we charge our Adverſaries with Innovation in the uſe they make of an Antient Rite, as Unction of the Sick is confeſſed to be, they have this at leaſt to return upon us, that we are guilty of as great an Innovation in making no uſe of it at all.</p>
                  <p>Now as to letting the diſpute fall, there had been ſome reaſon for it, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had either kept to the Ancient Unction, which directly referred to bodily Cures; or if when they were perhaps grown aſhamed of anointing the Sick for the recovery of their health, after long experience had ſhewn that the Remedy was all in vain; if then, I ſay, they had retained the Rite of Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under the notion of a Rite meerly ſtanding upon Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authority, and whatſoever plauſible ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had given it; if they had aſcribed no more ſpiritual effect to it than to the obſervation of any other mutable cuſtom of the Church; Had they ordered mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thus, and not intermedled againſt the liberty and authority of other Churches, I for my part am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that neither breach of Communion ought to have followed ſuch a proviſion, nor any ſuch controverſies raiſed about it, as would hazard the peace of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                  <p>But the matter is far otherwiſe. They thought it not worth the while, to retain it as a mutable Rite, but have given it the venerable name of a Sacrament, and as much as they can, the nature of a Sacrament too. They have found out a Grace for it, which they ſay it confers, and they have put the invention upon our Lord Jeſus, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60864:73"/>the recognition of it upon the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world. They have <hi>Anathematized</hi> all that dare to call it into queſtion; nor are they content to train up their own people in the belief that it takes away ſin, but they would make us ſuch hypocrites as to ſay that we believe it too; for with theſe men we can have no Communion unleſs we

                     <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that there are ſeven Sacraments of the new Law, truly and properly ſo called, inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and neceſſary to the Salvation of mankind;</hi> of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is one, <hi>and that they do confer Grace.</hi> Thus the caſe ſtands, and as it ſtands, let our enemies themſelves be our Judges, if the truth be on our ſide in this Queſtion, whether we have not all the reaſon in the world to avow it openly, and defend it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that relation of Biſhops and Presbyters to the particular Churches that are under their eſpecial care; they are alſo Miniſters of the Catholick Church, and by virtue of that relation wherein they ſtand to the whole, are bound to declare againſt intolerable abuſes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that do notoriouſly prevail in any part of it.</p>
                  <p>There are not many errors of more pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the ſouls of men, than to be made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that forgiveneſs of Sins, Grace, and Salvation, may be attained by things that are bleſt by man, without any appointment of God. Nor is it eaſie to give a worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Treachery in managing the care of ſouls, than to ſupport ſo dangerous a ſuperſtition, by pretending that God is the Author of thoſe Inſtitutions which he never eſtabliſhed, and of thoſe promiſes which he has no where made. What is this but under a pretence of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying men to heaven, to venture the diverting them out of the only way to it, which God has ſhewn; and to cheriſh a fatal ſuperſtition in the people, to which of themſelves they are ſtrangely prone, inſtead of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60864:74"/>and correcting it, as the <hi>Priests of the living God</hi> ought to do?</p>
                  <p>It is ſeldom ſeen that people are very much concerned for Eccleſiaſtical Rites and Cuſtoms, for which no other reaſons are pretended but thoſe of Prudence, Order and Expedience. But when they are made Myſteries, good to take away ſin, and to ſave the ſoul, no degree of zeal is thought to be too great for them. Men love to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a multitude of Ceremonies, and a Prieſt to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter them. But ſurely it is not ſo much the buſineſs of a <hi>Christian</hi> Prieſt to make himſelf neceſſary by decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and pleaſing others, as to pleaſe God, and to profit the flock of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He ſhould be content with ſo much dependence of the people upon him, as may be kept by ſpeaking truth, and doing his duty. But as for them that do not think this to be enough, but pretend to have ways of Gods appointing to take away ſin, which yet are meer inventions of their own, do they not at once abuſe the name of God, and gratifie their own ambition at the price of mens ſouls? Certainly if any occaſion of declaring the truth can be juſt, even when we know before hand that many will be offended with it; this is ſuch an occaſion. Expreſs warning ought to be given againſt the deceitful inſinuations of thoſe men, who talk of nothing more violently than the Salvation of ſouls, and who would almoſt make one believe that no body can be ſaved who does not paſs through their hands, nor any body damned that does. For if what they ſay of two of their Sacraments be true, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Penance,</hi> and of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> there is as little cauſe to fear damnation in their Church, as they ſay there is to hope for Salvation in ours. Of Confeſſion in Penance they ſay thus,
<note n="(l)" place="margin">Catech ad Par. P. II. de Paenit. Sect. 46, 47.</note> 
                     <hi>Granting that ſins are blotted out by contrition, who knows not that it ought to be ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60864:74"/>pungent and intenſe, that the bitterneſs of the grief may equal the greatneſs of the ſins? But becauſe very few would reach this degree, therefore the number of thoſe that could hope for the pardon of their ſins this way, muſt have been exceeding ſmall. Whence it was neceſſary that our moſt merciful Lord ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the common Salvation of men by an eaſier method, as he has done with admirable wiſdom, in delivering to the Church the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. For according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholick Faith, all are to believe, and conſtantly to affirm, that whoever is ſo diſpoſed as to be ſorry for the ſins he has done, and withal to purpoſe with himſelf that he will ſin no more, although he is not affected with that grief which may be ſufficient to obtain his pardon, yet when he has duly confeſſed his ſins to a Prieſt, all his ſins are pardoned and forgiven him by the power of the Keys.</hi> This is the Doctrine of their Famous <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm;</hi> and thus far ſufficient care is taken for mortal ſins by the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> that they ſhall be blotted out upon eaſie terms, if a man does but <hi>Grieve,</hi> and can hold his <hi>intention to amend,</hi> but ſo long till he receives Abſolution. Now this Sacrament being

For who is ſo bad as not to be ſorry at certain times, and to intend a new life for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially under the fear of death? But tho he ſhould afterwards take leave to <hi>retain</hi> his ſins, yet the Prieſt it ſeems had power to <hi>remit</hi> them before, and he has power to remit them ſo plentifully at laſt, that no <hi>Reliques of ſin</hi> ſhall remain behind, ſince the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is

                  <p>And thus 'tis left to the choice of their people, whether they will live according to that Truth which the Ch. of <hi>Rome</hi> holds with us, or according to thoſe Doctrines which they maintain and we reject; to their choice, I ſay, for any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they have to be afraid of going to Hell, if they have but the benefit of the power of the Keys, and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Churches Sacraments. I know indeed that ſome good things are ſaid by the Council in behalf of reformation of life, particularly in the place laſt cited, they ſay that
<note n="(q)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>the whole Chriſtian life ought to be a perpetual Penance;</hi> they meant, I hope, a ſtate of Amendment. But 'tis a very unlikely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that men ſhould be perſwaded to a holy life, when by thoſe Aſſurances that the Church has given them, they can ſo eaſily perſwade themſelves that they may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Nor is it very likely that many Confeſſors ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold either the ſaving uſe of the Keys, or the comfort of that uſe of them from wicked perſons, when they cannot do it without mending the Doctrine of their Church. And if any ſhould be ſo honeſt, there are yet others to be had, together with the word of the Church, to warrant the effect of the Sacraments, againſt the word of a ſingle Prieſt to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Againſt ſuch abuſes as theſe, we not only may, but ought to <hi>proteſt,</hi> if we ought to be concerned for the honour of God, and the ſouls of men; that we may warn all thoſe of our own Communion not to <hi>fall from their ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> and if poſſible, recover thoſe that are led away into theſe dangerous errors; or have been educated in the belief of them.</p>

                  <p>IF it be laid to our charge that we have no Unction of the Sick, we are very ſure that whatever Unction of the Sick, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can tax us for wanting, excepting

                  <p>We do not anoint the Sick as they did in the Primitive Church, becauſe we pretend not to the Supernatural Gift of Healing; and they anoint the Sick for this purpoſe in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no more than we.</p>
                  <p>We do not anoint the Sick as they began to do in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Age, when all ſick perſons were anointed in order to bodily Cures, but not to prepare their ſouls for death: No more do they of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not anoint neither with <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> as they indeed do: But the buſineſs of this Diſcourſe has been to ſhew that they ought to do it no more than we.</p>
                  <p>But the account we have to give of this matter is very plain, and ſuch as will bear us out to any man that asketh us a reaſon, whoever he be. For of thoſe Three Unctions, there is no colour to charge us with blame in omitting any of them, excepting the ſecond, which had the Authority of the middle Ages from the Seventh to the Twelfth. But that we are under no colour of Obligation to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that Authority, is plain to us from theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: That it was neither <hi>Primitive,</hi> nor has at any time been <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> nor had they who began it any good reaſon for what they did, but were themſelves to blame for beginning it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It was not Primitive,</hi> ſince by anointing all the Sick for the recovery of their Health, the Seventh Age departed from the example of the Six foregoing Ages, which are and ought to be of greater Authority than thoſe that followed. They had no ſtanding Offices for Unction of the Sick, nor knew of any other but that mentioned by St. <hi>James,</hi> when a Miraculous Cure followed. The Religion of being anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Health, by thoſe that had not the Gift of Healing, was ſo unknown a thing to Primitive Antiquity, that a Biſhop of the Fifth Age, wrote to the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> about
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60864:76"/>ſomething like it, as men uſe to do of things that had never been heard of before. Thoſe fancies of receiving Health by the uſe of <hi>Chriſm,</hi> began but then to ſtir, which afterwards ſetled into Rules and Offices for anointing all the ſick with Oyl for the Curing of their Diſeaſes. At firſt, in imitation of the Primitive way, not only Prieſts, but all Chriſtians might anoint for that purpoſe. But at length none but Prieſts muſt do it; and as Cuſtoms that are meerly of human Original do commonly begin with a rude and light draught, and in proceſs of time are filled up with artificial and regular Forms; ſo this Innovation which was at firſt begotten by Queſtions concerning the uſe of <hi>Chriſm</hi> in the time of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> grew in two or three Ages more into all its ſhapes, and became a ſetled myſtery. But though in reſpect of us it be indeed an <hi>Antient</hi> Innovation, yet an Innovation it was, and a <hi>late</hi> one too in reſpect of the truly Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It was never <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally practiſed;</hi> for beſides the Chriſtians of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> who had no uſe of Oyl at all in their Holy things; the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Church uſeth no Unction of the ſick; tho they have their
<note n="(r)" place="margin">Ludolf. Lib. III. Cap. 6. N. 31.</note> Holy Oyl, wherewith they anoint perſons to be Baptized; and ſo when the Miſſionaries from <hi>Rome</hi> came thither, they found theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<note n="(s)" place="margin">Ibid. Cap. V. N. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>utterly ignorant of Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> which by the way is a good evidence, if there were no other, that even the Unction which was not Extreme, was an Innovation. For
<note n="(t)" place="margin">Ibid. Cap. VI. N. 14, 15.</note> no people are more tenacious than they of Antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; inſomuch that <hi>the moſt Antient Ceremonies of the Old Church that are obſolete elſewhere, and now hardly known, are ſeen to continue amongſt them; ſo that their Rites being well conſidered in Baptiſm, the Euchariſt, Love-Feaſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>one would think he ſaw a kind of Image of the Primitive Church,</hi> as we are told in the beſt account that was ever yet given of the ſtate of that Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that began this kind of Unction, had no good Reaſon for what they did, and it is much eaſier to <hi>defend</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60864:76"/>our ſelves in refuſing to follow that example, than them for ſetting it. It may indeed be <hi>excuſed</hi> by a Pious intention of ſeeking Health this way from God, and refering it all to him; but thus may many other things be excuſed, which yet ought not to be imitated. Here was inded the Primitive Rite of Unction uſed, and that alſo for the ſame general end, for which it was uſed in the Primitive Church, <hi>viz.</hi> The Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of the Sick; but it was far from having the ſame ground and reaſon, becauſe it could be of no effect, the Gift of healing being diſcontinued: Which in truth made it look as untowardly, as if to recover any one to hearing and ſpeech, they had ordered the Prieſt to <hi>put his Finger into the Ears,</hi> and to <hi>touch the Tongue of</hi> the Patient becauſe
<note n="(u)" place="margin">Mark. vii.</note> our Lord did with ſuch ſigns recover one that was <hi>deaf, and had an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in his Speech;</hi> or that when the Prieſt could not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf go to pray over a ſick perſon, he ſhould ſend him a <hi>Handkerchief</hi> or an <hi>Apron from his Body,</hi> becauſe
<note n="(w)" place="margin">Acts xx. 12.</note> ſuch things being carried to the ſick from the Body of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> their <hi>Diſeaſes departed from them.</hi> For the reaſon of the thing ſeems to be much the ſame in all the three caſes. It is not very diſcreet, nor for the Honour of Religion to make any ſhew of a Miracle, when none is like to follow; nor to uſe a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rite for healing the Sick, which promiſes extraordinary matters, and yet People die as they did before; which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience was in all probability the reaſon of changing the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Age <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> into <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> they were aſhamed and weary of anointing for the Body, and ſo fell to anoint for the Soul.

But in the mean time, I hope the following Addreſs to the Laity of that Communion will not be thought unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, we are ſenſible at what diſadvantage we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lay the Truth before you; we know that the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices which have been infuſed into you againſt all that we can, ſay, are very great; but we would fain hope that they are not invincible. What is it, I beſeech you, in thoſe Guides you follow, to make you depend altogether upon their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? What is it in us that ſhould make every thing we ſay, ſuſpected and ſlighted? We do not love to enter into compariſon; but we can ſee no good reaſon for ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60864:77"/>If you ſay that they can teach nothing but truth in delivering the Doctrine of your Church; certainly, it ought to be a very ſtrong Reaſon that can ſupport ſuch a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a perſwaſion that whatſoever they ſay againſt us is True <hi>in General,</hi> againſt a terrible evidence, that 'tis all Falſe in the <hi>Particulars:</hi> Eſpecially, when we produce ſuch Evidence from thoſe Authorities upon which the General perſwaſion is ſaid to be built, <hi>i.e.</hi> from Scripture and Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>For Antiquity, many of you at leaſt muſt rely upon the skill and fidelity of others; and for our parts we deſire to be truſted, but as we deſerve. We think, the clearneſs of the Teſtimonies we produce, the manner of our citing Authors, and the connexion with which we take their periods, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a prudent perſon, who himſelf is unacquainted with the Fathers, to believe that we are fair Repreſenters of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>For Scripture, that indeed is a Rule which you may, but will not uſe; for let us produce places of Holy Writ never ſo many or ſo clear, you refer the Interpretation of them, to thoſe Guides againſt whom they are produced. So that ſtill they are believed upon their own Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>Is it becauſe you take their Skill and Learning to be greater than ours? But how can you be ſure of that, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different appearance which that difference would make in the management of theſe Controverſies?</p>
                  <p>Or do you believe us to be Hypocrites, and that ſincerity is to be met with no where, but in the Guides of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? <hi>We are Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God, no leſs than</hi> they; and we know that <hi>it is requir'd of Stewards that a man be found faithful.</hi> Conſider us, Brethren, that neither our Doctrine nor our Converſation in the World, carry the marks of Hypocriſy. Had we any other Intereſt to ſerve, but that of Truth, we alſo ſhould contend for Myſteries, by which the People get <hi>Eaſe</hi> and Liberty, and the Prieſt <hi>Power.</hi> We tax not your Prieſts of Inſincerity, nor enquire why they teach certain Doctrines, and adminiſter thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

We leave them to give an account of their ends and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, at the Day of Judgment, when the ſecrets of all Hearts ſhall be diſcloſed. But for our ſelves, we muſt needs ſay, That if we were diſpoſed to bend Religion to Worldly Intereſt, we ſhould maintain another part than what we are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for. To make the moſt of our Orders, we are very ſure that you ought to depend upon us for forgiveneſs of your ſins while you live, and when you are dying; and yet not ſo to be forgiven, but that there ſhould be a reckoning of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment behind, which would make us neceſſary for you when you are dead. Though you ſtill purpoſe Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life without performance, we would have Sacraments to ſave you from <hi>Hell;</hi> but a life of ſtrict Piety and Virtue, tho' crowned with <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> ſhould not excuſe you from <hi>Purgatory</hi> without a farther favour of the Church, that ſhould not be eaſily obtained neither. You cannot conclude that we are Inſincere, but at the ſame time you muſt take us for the veryeſt Fools alive, to ſtand as we do in our own Light, and to prefer a Hereſie that does us no manner of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, before that Truth which would bring all to depend upon us. Think upon this, and conſider at leaſt that you have no Reaſon to ſuſpect us of not believing our ſelves what we profeſs, or of conſulting our ſecular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, when we intreat you for the love of God, and for the ſake of your own Souls to weigh impartially what we ſay; which if you would do, we doubt not in the leaſt, but you would find our <hi>Cauſe</hi> to be as good as our <hi>meaning.</hi> Only let not prejudice extinguiſh the very deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better things, nor an
